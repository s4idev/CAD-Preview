# File Formats

CAD Preview supports two classes of 3D files: **B-rep** (boundary representation) formats that require tessellation, and **mesh** formats that are already triangulated.

## B-rep Formats (OCCT Pipeline)

B-rep files describe solid geometry analytically (surfaces, edges, vertices) rather than as triangles. CAD Preview tessellates them on-the-fly using [OpenCascade.js](https://ocjs.org/).

### Processing Steps

1. **Read** — the appropriate OCCT reader parses the file bytes:
   - STEP: `STEPControl_Reader_1`
   - IGES: `IGESControl_Reader_1`
   - BREP: `BRep_Builder` + `BRepTools::Read`
2. **Tessellate** — `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh_2` with:
   - Linear deflection: `0.1`
   - Angular deflection: `0.5` (radians)

   A shape with **no sub-shapes at all** (an empty `TopoDS_Compound`) skips this step entirely and yields zero groups. That is not merely an optimization: handing an empty compound to `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh_2` aborts the whole OCCT WASM instance — a hard fault, not a catchable OCCT exception — so the guard is what makes an empty document (see below) and any op list that reduces a model to nothing degrade honestly instead of poisoning the kernel. A shape that has vertices/edges but no faces meshes fine and is deliberately left alone.
3. **Extract faces** — `TopExp_Explorer` walks the `TopoDS_Shape`, visiting each `TopoDS_Face`. For each face, the triangulation (`Poly_Triangulation`) is pulled from the location-transformed face and converted to WebGL-ready `Float32Array` positions and `Uint32Array` indices. Each face gets a stable id (`face-N`, deterministic explorer order) and records its parent solid.
4. **Extract edges** — `extractEdges()` walks every `TopoDS_Edge`, de-duplicating shared edges by `HashCode` + `IsSame` (this OCCT build does not bind `TopTools_IndexedMapOfShape`), and discretizes each unique edge to a polyline via `BRepAdaptor_Curve` + `GCPnts_UniformDeflection`. Each gets a stable id (`edge-N`).
5. **Group** — faces are collected into `SolidGroup`s, one per top-level solid (`TopAbs_SOLID`). In the webview each face becomes its own `THREE.Mesh` and each edge its own `THREE.Line`, parented under a per-solid `THREE.Group` — so faces, edges, and solids can all be picked and coloured independently.
6. **Encode** — positions and indices are base64-encoded and posted to the webview as `EncodedMesh` (faces) and `EncodedEdge` (edges) objects.

### Tessellation Quality

The linear deflection of `0.1` is a reasonable default for mechanical parts. Decrease it (e.g. `0.01`) for smoother curved surfaces at the cost of more triangles. This value is hardcoded in `src/meshExtract.ts`; it is not currently user-configurable.

### Solid Grouping

A `SolidGroup` maps to one `THREE.Group` child of the root, holding one `THREE.Mesh` per face. The `userData.groupId` (the solid id) links faces to the component tree panel for highlighting; each face mesh also carries `userData.entityType = "surface"` and `userData.entityId = face-N`. Each group's `faceCount` is the number of OCCT faces (not triangles) that were extracted.

### STEP

STEP (ISO 10303) is the most common exchange format for CAD. CAD Preview reads AP203 and AP214 (and AP242 in practice). Shell assemblies, free surfaces, and wire edges are not rendered — only faces that yield a triangulation.

### IGES

IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) is an older format. The OCCT reader handles most IGES entity types but edge cases (trimmed surfaces, complex NURBS) may result in incomplete geometry.

### BREP

BREP is OpenCascade's native binary topology format. It reads fast and has no conversion artifacts. The `BRepTools::Read` function parses directly into a `TopoDS_Shape`.

### OpenSCAD CSG

OpenSCAD's `.csg` export is the fully evaluated model — loops unrolled, modules inlined, variables literalised, every transform an explicit node — so there is no language to implement. `src/csgImport.ts` (pure, headless-tested) parses the text into an AST; `src/csgModel.ts` builds it kernel-side with live handles into an **opaque base shape** (like a STEP import — user edits layer on top via the sidecar, the parsed structure is not itself an edit history).

Built: `cube`, `sphere`, `cylinder`, `polyhedron` (sewn, closure-checked), `hull` (convex hull of the children's tessellated vertices — `src/convexHull.ts`; OCCT ships no convex-hull algorithm), `union`/`difference`/`intersection`, `group`, `color` (transparent), `multmatrix`/`translate`/`rotate`/`scale`/`mirror` (all through one `gp_GTrsf` path — shear included, no decomposition needed), `linear_extrude`/`rotate_extrude` of a single `polygon`/`square`/`circle` child (2D `(x, y)` read as (radius, height) for revolve; `twist`/`scale` and `paths=` holes are a later phase and skip with a warning; `slices`/`convexity` are preview-only and ignored). Skipped with a `load_model` warning (whole subtree dropped): `minkowski` (no OCCT equivalent), `text`/`import`/`surface` (external files/fonts), standalone 2D (`square`/`circle`/`polygon` outside an extrude), multi/union 2D extrude children, and anything unknown.

Two correctness rules worth knowing: OpenSCAD cylinders/spheres are **faceted prisms**, not analytic surfaces — `$fn`/`$fa`/`$fs` resolve per node and `useMaxFN` (default 16, FreeCAD's dial) decides real N-gon prism vs analytic import, with a warning stating the chord error whenever it approximates. And `.csg` prints at ~6 significant figures, a hard accuracy ceiling on anything reconstructed from it.

A third rule matters when booleans are involved, because this OCCT build is not robust on real models: a `union()` fuse can silently lose geometry on a coplanar touch, and a `cut` can raise a C++ exception that surfaces as a plain JS `ReferenceError` (`___cxa_can_catch is not defined` — the build ships no Emscripten exception runtime). **Neither may cost you the model.** A `union` that cannot fuse one operand leaves that operand out and keeps fusing the rest (reported as `union() — N of M operand(s) could not be combined and were left out of the result`); a `difference` whose cut throws leaves that subtrahend uncut and keeps the cuts that already succeeded. Measured on a real moulded enclosure: one throwing cut used to discard an entire 11.5 cm³ part, and an uncombined-union fallback inflated the tray by 1.7% while poisoning the next boolean — both now reproduce OpenSCAD's own render to within 0.14%.

**Cost and face count.** A boolean fragmentizes its operands (the enclosure's 18-operand union leaves 2745 faces where the geometry needs 552), so every boolean result is passed through `ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain` — volume-guarded, and skipped below 256 faces, so small models keep the decomposition they always had. On that enclosure it halves the document (2745 → 1312 faces, its tray 1085 → 187) and takes tessellation from 1.31s to 0.72s; volumes are unchanged to within 3e-9 relative, and the solid decomposition is the design's own.

A larger saving was available and is **deliberately not taken**: merging each coplanar group of a `hull()`'s triangles into one face cuts the build from 19s to 5.5s, but it also makes this OCCT build fail to glue a coplanar face-to-face contact — the enclosure came back as 14 solids instead of 10, with two detached 2.7mm³ tabs and two zero-volume sheets, while the *total* volume stayed exact. Since the volume is what a model is usually judged by, the only way to see it is a per-solid inventory, and the only correct forms are the ones that leave the operands' faces alone. So: an import here keeps the solid decomposition OpenSCAD itself produces, at the cost of some speed.

### OpenSCAD Source

A `.scad` file is evaluated by a user-installed `openscad` binary into `.csg` text (`src/scadService.ts`, host-side), then takes the exact path above — downstream only ever sees `.csg` bytes. Three things this implies, each deliberate:

1. **The binary is a prerequisite, not a fallback.** Without one, every `.scad` entry point degrades to `{supported: false}` (headless) or an install-hint error (interactive) — never a throw for a missing capability, never a silent skip. Configure it via the `cadPreview.openscadBinary` setting, else the `OPENSCAD_BINARY` environment variable (the headless escape hatch), else `openscad` on `PATH`.
2. **Conversion runs with `cwd` = the source directory on the real path** (never a temp copy), so relative `use`/`include`/`import` resolve exactly as a manual `openscad -o model.csg model.scad` invocation would. The output goes to a temp dir that is always removed afterwards, success or failure.
3. **Conversion is capped at a 2-minute kill** (`SCAD_CONVERT_TIMEOUT_MS`): a `.scad` file is effectively evaluated code and can hang (runaway recursion, gigantic `import`), so the timeout is the sandbox backstop, not just UX. openscad's own stderr chatter surfaces as (capped) warnings; a non-zero exit surfaces its stderr tail as the error.

## Mesh Formats (Three.js Pipeline)

Mesh files contain pre-triangulated geometry. The extension host resolves the file to a `vscode-webview://` URI via `webviewPanel.webview.asWebviewUri()` and posts it to the webview, which loads it directly with a Three.js loader.

### STL

Binary and ASCII STL are both supported via `STLLoader`. The result is a single `THREE.Mesh`. Vertex normals are embedded in the STL format; they are used as-is.

**Limitation:** STL has no material, color, or hierarchy. A default grey `MeshStandardMaterial` is applied.

### OBJ

`OBJLoader` produces a `THREE.Group` of meshes corresponding to the `o` / `g` groups in the OBJ file.

**Limitation:** `.mtl` material files are not loaded. If the OBJ file references an MTL, the material block is ignored and a default material is applied by `applyDefaultMaterial()` in `src/webview/meshLoaders.ts`.

### PLY

`PLYLoader` loads the file as a single `THREE.BufferGeometry`. If the PLY file lacks vertex normals, `computeVertexNormals()` is called automatically to generate smooth normals.

**Limitation:** Vertex colors in PLY are not currently applied to the material.

### glTF / GLB

`GLTFLoader` supports the full glTF 2.0 spec, including embedded textures, materials, and scene hierarchies. CAD Preview uses `gltf.scene` (the root `THREE.Group`) from the parsed result.

**Limitations:**

- Animation playback is not supported. Only the bind pose (frame 0) is rendered.
- The component tree is built from the `Object3D` name hierarchy, not from glTF extras.

**Host-side parsing.** Display goes through Three.js's `GLTFLoader` as described above, but a *second*, independent path exists for the features that need triangle geometry outside the webview: `src/gltfParser.ts` is a pure, hand-rolled glTF 2.0 / GLB parser (the fourth member of the `stlParser.ts` / `objParser.ts` / `plyParser.ts` family) that reads every mesh primitive's `POSITION` attribute and indices, transforms them by each node's world matrix, and welds the result into one shared index space. It is **geometry-only** — materials, textures, cameras, skins, animations, and morph targets are ignored entirely — and its unit tests cross-check every fixture against three.js's own `GLTFLoader` (`src/gltfParser.crossvalidation.test.ts`), which is what makes hand-rolling it defensible: a subtly-wrong parser producing plausible-but-wrong centroids and volumes would be worse than not supporting the format at all. This is what makes **Compare Models**, **check_mesh_health**, **promote_mesh_to_brep**, and **silhouette SVG export** work for `.gltf`/`.glb` sources.

Two host-side-parsing caveats, both surfaced as clear errors rather than silently-wrong geometry:

- **Compressed geometry is rejected.** A file whose `extensionsRequired` names `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` or `EXT_meshopt_compression` fails with an error naming the extension — this parser cannot decode compressed buffers. (Geometry-irrelevant extensions — `KHR_materials_*`, `KHR_texture_transform`, `KHR_lights_punctual`, … — are handled perfectly by ignoring them, and `KHR_mesh_quantization` is genuinely supported.)
- **External `.bin` buffers are read from beside the model.** A `.gltf` whose `buffers[].uri` points at a sibling file works normally; a sibling that can't be read is a clear error, not a silently-empty mesh. A self-contained `.glb`, or a `.gltf` with base64 data URIs, needs no sibling at all.

Fixtures: `examples/GLTF/cube.gltf`, `examples/GLTF/cube.glb`, and `examples/GLTF/two-boxes.gltf`.

## meshio++ Bridge Formats (VTK, MED, CGNS, Exodus, XDMF, Kratos MDPA, OpenFOAM, and more)

These formats — VTK/VTU, MED, CGNS, Exodus, XDMF, Kratos MDPA, OpenFOAM, Gmsh Mesh, Abaqus, I-DEAS Universal, SU2, INRIA Medit, and GiD Postprocess — have no native Three.js loader, so the extension host converts them to a triangulated **boundary surface** in STL form first — [meshio++](https://github.com/loumalouomega/meshioplusplus) (`@meshioplusplus/wasm`, a third host-side WASM module alongside OCCT and Gmsh) reads the source file and calls `convertSurface` (entirely inside its C++ core — a volume mesh becomes its boundary, everything else passes through), producing ASCII STL bytes. Those bytes are sent to the webview (`loadMeshBytes` protocol message, base64-over-postMessage) and fed through the **exact same STL loader** a native `.stl` open uses — see `src/meshioService.ts`'s `convertToStlBoundary()` and `doc/gmsh-integration.md`'s "The meshio++ bridge" section (which also covers the reverse direction: exporting a *generated* FE mesh to MED/CGNS/XDMF/VTU/and more, independent of this import path). Nastran (`.bdf`) is routed, and its read-side `BEGIN BULK` normalization is enough for a Gmsh-written deck to import: `npm run compat`'s `load-bdf-gmsh-export` row and `npm run mcp:smoke` both open `examples/Nastran/block-tets.bdf` and remesh it. A standard fixed-field deck written by another tool is still untested — see the roadmap's [Nastran bulk-deck import](roadmap.md#nastran-bulk-deck-import).

OpenFOAM is the one exception to the single-file shape: a `.foam` file is an (usually empty) **marker** — the ParaView convention — whose real mesh lives in sibling files under `<marker's parent>/constant/polyMesh/`. `src/meshioService.ts`'s `convertFoamCaseToStlBoundary(markerPath)` takes the marker's filesystem path, stages the whole case into meshio++'s virtual filesystem itself, and hand-builds the STL by fan-triangulating every boundary face (meshio++'s own STL writer emits zero facets for the quad-only boundaries typical of hex-dominant CFD meshes). OpenFOAM import is **geometry-only**: patch names ride a C++ side-channel its JS binding doesn't expose, and field files in the case's time directories are not read at all — no Parts are auto-created and the colour-by-field selector stays empty.

**Gmsh Mesh / Abaqus / I-DEAS Universal / SU2 / INRIA Medit close a real export/import asymmetry**: the FE Mesh panel already *wrote* `.msh`/`.inp`/`.unv`/`.su2`/`.mesh` via Gmsh's own writer, but until now had no way to re-*open* any of them — this codebase's own exported files were not importable. Each was verified round-trippable end-to-end against the live WASM (export a real tetrahedralized model, then `readMesh()` the result back) before being added. `.off`, which Gmsh also writes, was tried and **rejected** after the same check (`"Expected the first line to be 'OFF'"` — Gmsh's output isn't shaped the way meshio++'s OFF reader expects), so it is not an import format. **Nastran (`.bdf`) is routed and imports this extension's own Gmsh-written decks** (the read-side `BEGIN BULK` normalization gives meshio++'s C++ reader the line it needs; verified by `npm run compat`'s `load-bdf-gmsh-export` row and by `mcp:smoke`'s `generate_mesh` on `examples/Nastran/block-tets.bdf`, which returns real nodes/elements). A standard fixed-field deck from another tool has no fixture here and is therefore untested rather than claimed — see the roadmap's [Nastran bulk-deck import](roadmap.md#nastran-bulk-deck-import). `.bdf` is also the X11 bitmap-font extension, so opening one shows a one-line caveat, like `.msh`/`.inp`.

**GiD Postprocess (`.post.msh`) is a sibling pair, and a compound extension.** Its ascii flavour splits a model across `<stem>.post.msh` (geometry) and `<stem>.post.res` (results), the second discovered purely by swapping that final segment — nothing inside the `.post.msh` names it. CAD Preview routes only the `.post.msh`; the `.post.res` is not independently openable (it is not a mesh) but is staged alongside the primary by the same `src/meshioCompanions.ts` machinery that stages XDMF's `.h5`. Because `.post.msh` **ends in `.msh`**, which is registered to a different format (Gmsh), `routeFile` matches the **longest registered suffix first** — a last-dot-only lookup would silently resolve every GiD file to a Gmsh parse that then fails, which is precisely the bug meshio++ itself had to fix in its own `resolve_format` in 10.18.0. Only the ascii flavour is claimed: meshio++ also reads GiD's `binary` (`.post.bin`) and `hdf5` (`.post.h5`) flavours, but this codebase has no fixture verifying either. GiD is also an **export** target — see `doc/gmsh-integration.md`'s "The meshio++ bridge".

**`.msh` and `.inp` are ambiguous extensions**, each used by more than one format meshio++ can read (`.msh`: Gmsh, ANSYS, FreeFem; `.inp`: Abaqus, ANSYS APDL). CAD Preview always assumes the format it itself writes (Gmsh for `.msh`, Abaqus for `.inp`) and shows a one-line status caveat on open — an ANSYS-authored `.msh` or `.inp` file will not parse correctly. There is deliberately no content-sniffing disambiguation into the alternate formats: this codebase has no real ANSYS/FreeFem-authored fixture to verify such a read against, so claiming that support would be an unverified promise (see `src/fileRouter.ts`'s `AMBIGUOUS_MESHIO_EXTENSIONS`).

**XDMF's `.h5` sibling is now staged automatically.** Earlier versions of this bridge wrote only the primary file's bytes into meshio++'s MEMFS, so an XDMF using the (default) `"HDF"` heavy-data format could never be read back at all (`HDF5: could not open file ...h5`) — every attempt failed before meshio++ ever got as far as interpreting the mesh. Opening an `.xdmf` now scans its own `<DataItem Format="HDF">` references (`src/meshioCompanions.ts`'s `extractXdmfHdfReferences`, a plain regex scan — no XML parser in this vitest config) and stages the referenced `.h5` file(s) alongside it under their exact referenced basename, if present beside the source. An XDMF using the `"XML"`/`"Binary"` data formats needs no companion and is unaffected either way.

**Mixed-topology XDMF round-trips with meshio++ 16.16.0.** The earlier `XDMF: unknown mixed topology index` reader defect is fixed upstream. Exports from this extension, including mixed point/line/triangle/tetra blocks, can be reopened and re-meshed when their referenced `.h5` companion is present. This is covered by the compatibility corpus and MCP smoke test.

### Processing Steps

1. **Companions** — for a multi-file format (currently: XDMF's `.h5`), the host resolves and reads whatever sibling the source references, from beside the source file (`provider.ts`'s `resolveMeshioCompanionsFor` / `mcpTools.ts`'s `resolveMeshioCompanions` — the disk-I/O half; `meshioCompanions.ts`'s `meshioCompanionCandidates` is the pure, shared "which basenames to look for" half). A missing companion is silently skipped, not an error — a self-contained source still opens.
2. **Read + convert** — `convertToStlBoundaryWithRegions(sourceBytes, format, sourceName, companions)` stages the primary (and any companions) into meshio++'s own virtual filesystem under their real basenames, `readMesh()`s the full mesh, and — when the file declares ≥1 named `kind: "cell"` region and the boundary comes back pure triangles — correlates each boundary triangle to its region via `extractSurface(mesh, recordParentIds=true)`'s `cell_data["surface:parent_cell"]` provenance array. Falls back to the plain `convertToStlBoundary()` (`convertSurface(inPath, outPath, {inFormat: format, outFormat: "stl"})`) with no region data for anything else (quad/hex boundaries, no regions, correlation finding nothing).
3. **Transport** — the resulting STL bytes are base64-encoded and posted as `{type: "loadMeshBytes", sourceFormat, dataBase64, regionAssignment?}`.
4. **Load** — the webview base64-decodes them, wraps them in a `blob:` object URL, and calls the same `loadMeshFromUrl(url, "stl")` a native `.stl` open uses — from this point on, a meshio-imported document is **indistinguishable from a native STL** to every other feature (facet splitting, Parts, Edits, Export, Mass Properties, Measurement all work identically). When `regionAssignment` is present, the facet split is region-aware (see below) so a Part auto-created from a region references real, resolvable facet ids.

### What's Preserved, What's Not

Only geometry (points + triangle connectivity) becomes actual geometry through this funnel. **Named `kind: "cell"` regions now DO become real Parts**, for the tetrahedral/triangular-boundary case: on first import (only when the parts sidecar is still empty — an existing Part is never overwritten), CAD-Preview auto-creates one selectable, colourable Part per region (`src/meshioRegionParts.ts`'s `buildPartsFromMeshioRegions`), persisted to the usual `<model>.parts.json` sidecar exactly like a manually-created Part. This works identically whether the file is opened in VS Code or loaded headlessly via the MCP server's `load_model` (one shared implementation, not two that could drift).

**Named point/cell scalar data arrays (temperatures, stresses, …) can now be visualized too — interactively, via the view-controls "Colour by field" selector** (webview-only, no MCP tool). Picking a field fetches its values on demand (`src/meshioService.ts`'s `readMeshioFieldValues`, same triangle-boundary correlation mechanism as region→Parts) and paints the model as a viridis colour ramp with a legend; picking "None" reverts. This is display-only — no new data is stored, exported, or made selectable/queryable, and a field's actual per-point/per-cell values are never available headlessly via the MCP server. Quad/hex volume boundaries, `kind: "point"`/`"side"` regions, and whole-mesh `field_data` (not spatially varying — nothing to colour by) are still **not** handled by any mechanism — their NAMES are surfaced informationally only (a one-line status message on open, and a `load_model` warning via the MCP server). See CLAUDE.md's "meshio++ integration" section for the full mechanism and its exact scope. If you need to actually inspect scalar field values numerically, use a dedicated FE post-processing tool (e.g. ParaView) for these formats; CAD-Preview's support here is for quick geometry/region/field previews alongside your CAD files, not full FE post-processing.

### Kratos MDPA note

Unlike the MDPA **export** path (`src/mdpaWriter.ts`, hand-written — see `doc/gmsh-integration.md`'s "Kratos MDPA" section), **importing** an `.mdpa` file as a document goes through meshio++'s own native MDPA reader (mesh-level blocks only — `Nodes`/`Elements`/`Conditions`/`SubModelPart`; Kratos `Properties`/`Table`/`Geometries`/`Constraints` blocks are not represented in the WASM binding and throw if present, same as everywhere else meshio++ reads MDPA). These are two entirely independent code paths that happen to share a file extension — one reads MDPA (via meshio++, for the Components view), the other writes MDPA (hand-rolled, for FE mesh export) — neither replaces the other. Non-sequential ("gapped") node ids — routine in real Kratos decks, since SubModelPart extraction, entity removal and deck merging all leave them — are supported (`@meshioplusplus/wasm` ≥ 9.13; regression-fixture: `examples/MDPA/gapped-ids.mdpa`, whose original ids surface as `mdpa:id` point/cell data names).

---

## Parts Sidecar (`<model>.parts.json`)

User-defined **parts** (named groups of volumes / surfaces / lines) are stored in a JSON sidecar written **next to** the CAD file — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.parts.json`. Part assignments never modify the CAD file itself — a Part edit writes only this sidecar. The sidecar is read on open (`readParts()`) and autosaved, debounced, on every edit (`writeParts()`), both in `src/partsStore.ts`. Parsing and serialization live in the vscode-free `src/partsSidecar.ts` so they are unit-tested.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "bull.stp",
  "parts": [
    {
      "name": "Inlet",
      "color": "#e6194b",
      "volumes": ["solid-0"],
      "surfaces": ["face-3", "face-7"],
      "lines": ["edge-12"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Entity ids are the stable topological ids assigned during extraction (`solid-*`, `face-*`, `edge-*`). For mesh formats (which have no stored B-rep topology), the whole object is a **volume** with a stable traversal-order id (`node-*`), and each connected near-coplanar **facet** detected on load is a **surface** (`node-*/face-*`); meshes have no assignable lines. Ids stay valid as long as the source file is unchanged. Parsing is tolerant: a missing or hand-corrupted sidecar yields an empty part list rather than blocking the model from opening.

A part may additionally carry a re-executable `selector` (a SelectorQuery, same shape `resolve_selector` takes) beside its raw `surfaces` cache, plus a `selectorOpKind` tag naming the producing op's kind at synthesis time. The host re-resolves the query against the current op list on open and after every op-list change, overwriting `surfaces` only on an oracle-clean result — otherwise the cache freezes with a warning (a stored op index that now addresses a different op kind freezes rather than repointing). A malformed selector is dropped while the part survives on its raw ids. `set_part` accepts the query and derives the kind tag server-side from the current op list, so write-time mismatch is impossible by construction.

## Edits Sidecar (`<model>.edits.json`)

User-applied **edit operations** (transforms and booleans, and — in later milestones — feature modeling, assembly) are stored in a **second** JSON sidecar next to the CAD file — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.edits.json`. Applying an edit itself never writes the CAD file — only this sidecar changes on every op. The sidecar holds an **ordered, replayable op-list** that is re-applied on every open, so the displayed model is `base shape ∘ ops`. It is read on open (`readEdits()`) and autosaved, debounced, on every change (`writeEdits()`), both in `src/editsStore.ts`; parse/serialize live in the vscode-free `src/editsSidecar.ts` so they are unit-tested.

The source file is written only by an explicit, confirmed action — Ctrl+S on a dirty tab (for STEP/IGES/BREP/STL/OBJ/PLY), an Export pick of the source's own format ("save in place"), or the headless `save_model` MCP tool — never as a side effect of applying or autosaving an edit. That save **bakes** the unbaked op tail into the file and records how far via a `bakedThrough` watermark: the file on disk already contains `ops[0..bakedThrough]`, so replay starts after it and every kernel replay consumes only the tail. The field is omitted when `0`, so a never-saved-in-place document's sidecar is byte-identical to before this feature existed; parsing clamps an out-of-range value instead of throwing. Undo cannot cross the save point, and `remove_edit_op` refuses an index inside the baked prefix headless.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "bull.stp",
  "variables": [
    { "name": "L", "expr": "20", "value": 20 },
    { "name": "W", "expr": "L/2", "value": 10 }

### Parametric variables

The optional top-level `variables` array holds the document's named **parametric variables** (`{name, expr, value}`), and any op may carry an optional `exprs` annotation mapping a numeric field path (`length`, `size[1]`, `points[2][0]`) to an expression string over them. Editing a variable in the panel re-resolves every annotated op and rebuilds the geometry live. Rules:

- **Numeric fields are last-good caches.** The addressed field always holds the most recent successful evaluation, so a consumer that ignores `exprs` (or an older extension version) still sees a fully-resolved op. Parsing re-resolves ops against the variables (`parseEditsJson`), so hand-editing a variable's `expr` in the sidecar takes effect on the next open.
- **Expressions** support numbers, variable names, `+ - * / ^`, parentheses, `sqrt/abs/min/max/floor/ceil/round/sin/cos/tan` (trig in **degrees**, matching the `*Deg` angle fields), and `pi`. Evaluation is a small closed interpreter (`src/paramExpr.ts`) — never `eval()`.
- **A variable may reference only variables defined above it** in the list (derived values like `W = L/2` work; cycles are unrepresentable). A variable whose expression fails keeps its cached `value`.
- **Failures freeze, never crash:** an op whose expression references a deleted variable — or whose resolved values would violate a cross-field invariant (e.g. a torus with `minorRadius ≥ majorRadius`) — keeps its previous numbers and a warning is shown; replay continues.
- **Stored operand queries** are the id-field counterpart of `exprs`: `targetQueries` maps an operand field (`targets`, `a`/`b`, `edges`, `profile`, `faceA`, …) to a SelectorQuery (same shape `resolve_selector` takes), with `targetQueryKinds` carrying one producing-op-kind tag per bucket query. The id arrays stay the last-good caches; resolution is **host-side and replay-only** (`src/opQueryResolve.ts`) — the sidecar keeps queries + caches untouched, and every freeze (forward reference, kind-tag mismatch, pattern producer, unresolved/empty) keeps the cache and surfaces a warning. Mesh sources never resolve queries (they replay on cached ids); queries are refused inside `repeat` bodies.
- `variables` is omitted when empty, so pre-parametric sidecars are unchanged. The `version` stays `1`. Note: an **older** extension version rewriting the sidecar drops `variables` and `exprs` (it serializes only what it knows).

**Where ops are applied** mirrors the read/export split:

| Source pipeline | Edit engine | Supported ops (current) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B-rep (STEP/IGES/BREP) | host, OCCT (`applyEditsBRep`, `src/occtOperations.ts`) | every op kind: transforms, boolean, fillet/chamfer, extrude/revolve/sweep/loft (filled or thin-walled, optional region `pick`), shell/draft/defeature/splitByPlane/section/drill, explode/mate, all primitives (incl. wedge) and holes, all 2D profile sketches, all curves, and the bottom-up wireframe/build ops |
| Mesh (STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF) | webview, Three.js (`applyEditsMesh`, `src/webview/meshEdits.ts`) | translate, rotate, scale, mirror, boolean (via `three-bvh-csg`), explode, addBox, addSphere, addCylinder, addCone, addTorus, addPrism, and the hole family (addHole/addCounterboreHole/addCountersinkHole, via CSG subtraction) — everything else (fillet/chamfer, feature-modeling, shell/draft/defeature/split/section, mate, wedge, the 2D profile ops, curves, and the bottom-up wireframe ops) is B-rep only |

Primitive-creation ops (`addBox`/`addSphere`/`addCylinder`/`addCone`/`addTorus`/ `addPrism`) are an op family that needs **no existing operands** — they build a new body from parameters alone and append it, on both pipelines, no B-rep-only restriction (`addWedge` is the exception: B-rep only). The hole ops (`addHole`/`addCounterboreHole`/`addCountersinkHole`) are the opposite of the other `add*` ops — **subtractive**: they cut a cylindrical (optionally counterbored/countersunk) hole into the selected target volumes, on both pipelines.

The 2D profile ops (`addCircleProfile`/`addRectangleProfile`/`addPolygonProfile`/ `addEllipseProfile`/`addRoundedRectangleProfile`/`addSlotProfile`/ `addTrapezoidProfile`) similarly need no operands, but build a **flat face** (no thickness) rather than a solid, and are B-rep only — their purpose is to be picked (Surf mode) as an `extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep`/`loft` profile afterward. A *curve* op's edges can be picked (Line mode) as a profile too, closed or open — see the sweep-family paragraph below. The curve ops (`addPolyline`/`addThreePointArc`/`addSpline`/`addBezier`/ `addEllipseArc`/`addHelix`) append standalone edges the same way the wireframe ops below do (B-rep only; `addSpline` is an approximating, endpoint-exact fit). The modify ops (`shell`/`draft`/`defeature`/`splitByPlane`/`section`/`drill`, B-rep only) reshape existing solids: shell hollows the solids owning the selected opening faces, draft tapers faces (currently a kernel-limited honest skip — see `doc/getting-started.md`), defeature removes faces as recognized features via `BRepAlgoAPI_Defeaturing` with the solid healing behind them, split cuts the targets by a plane keeping one or both sides, section appends the planar cross-section as a sketch face without touching the solids, and drill cuts the picked regions of a profile face/wire through the targets (one prism per region down an explicit `dir` × `length`). They're grouped together under a `"Sketches"` pseudo-body in the Components tree/view, made visible by a "free-face" pass in the tessellation pipeline (see `doc/extension-host-api.md`). Extruding/ revolving/sweeping/lofting a sketch consumes it into the resulting solid — it doesn't leave a duplicate face behind. **A thin-walled feature is the exception**: it builds its own band face from the sketch's outline and consumes that instead, so the sketch survives in `"Sketches"` and can be reused.

The four sweep-family ops (`extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep`/`loft`) accept an optional **`thin`** — the total wall thickness — to build a thin-walled body instead of a filled one, plus **`thinOuter`** for how much of that wall sits outside the profile boundary (`0`, the default, grows it entirely inward; `thinOuter === thin` entirely outward; anything between is a band straddling the outline). The profile is offset into that band before the ordinary builder runs, so the result is an ordinary solid in every other respect. A profile that already has a hole is refused rather than silently losing it.

They also take their profile in either of **two mutually exclusive forms** — exactly one must be present. `profile` (`profiles` for loft) is a `face-N`, as before. `profileEdges` (`profileEdgeSets` for loft, one set per section) is a set of `edge-N` ids assembled into a single wire, which is how an **open** sketch is consumed: an `addPolyline` with `closed: false` contributes one `edge-N` per segment, and those edges are the profile. The edges may be listed in any order — they are joined by their shared vertices — and a genuinely disconnected set is skipped with a diagnostic. A *closed* edge set behaves exactly like the equivalent face, filled or thin. An *open* one encloses no area, so it **requires** `thin`: its wall is a band centred on the spine with semicircular ends, which is also why `thinOuter` is refused there (an open wire has no inside or outside). Every section of a loft must agree on closedness.

The single-profile three (`extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep`, not `loft`) also accept an optional region **`pick`** narrowing which enclosed regions of a multi-region profile are consumed: a face's wires enumerate to regions (`0` = outer boundary, `1..N` = inner loops in order), an edge profile exposes a single region. Omitted (or `"outer"`) consumes the face as modeled, holes preserved; `"all"` — or any list containing `0` — consumes the outer boundary with every hole filled; a list without `0` builds each picked inner loop as a standalone island body. An out-of-range index skips with a diagnostic naming the loop count, and an explicit `pick` refuses `thin` (thin walls build from the outer boundary alone). `drill` cuts the same picked regions through target solids instead of appending them: one prism per region down an explicit `dir` × `length`, subtracted from the targets (no up-to-face variant).

Both fields are ordinary numeric op fields, so a parametric variable can drive them like any other — sketch a rectangle, then extrude it as a tube whose wall is a variable:

```parametric
{
  "variables": [{ "name": "wall", "expr": "2" }],
  "steps": [
    { "op": { "op": "addRectangleProfile", "center": [0, 0, 0], "normal": [0, 0, 1], "up": [1, 0, 0], "width": 40, "height": 25 } },
    { "op": { "op": "extrude", "profile": "face-6", "dir": [0, 0, 1], "length": 30, "thin": 2, "exprs": { "thin": "wall" } } }
  ]
}
```

The bottom-up wireframe ops (`addPoint`/`addLine`/`addArc`/`addSurfaceFromLines`/ `addVolumeFromSurfaces`) let a shape be built up the traditional CAD way instead of from parametric primitives or profile extrusion: place standalone points, connect them with lines/arcs (typed endpoints, not point references), select a closed set of lines and **Build → Surface** to assemble a face, then select a closed set of surfaces and **Build → Volume** to sew them into a solid. **`addSurfaceFromLines` also accepts SEVERAL disjoint closed loops in one selection, as long as they form exactly one outer boundary plus its holes** (roadmap "3D text via outline import") — a letter with a counter, e.g. an imported "O"'s outer ring and inner ring, builds as one holed face rather than needing a manual boolean; a selection spanning more than one outer loop (two unrelated letters, say) is refused with a message naming the region count, since each region is its own op. Like the 2D profile ops, all five are B-rep only — meshes have no wire/sewing concept — and a point-select mode (`📍 Point`) shows every vertex in the model (original geometry's corners as well as added points), consistent with how Vol/Surf/Line already show everything. An `addSurfaceFromLines`/`addVolumeFromSurfaces` selection that doesn't actually close (open chain of lines, open shell of surfaces) is skipped gracefully — no error, no op applied.

Op order is preserved (replay depends on it). Parsing is tolerant: malformed ops are dropped via `validateEditOp` (`src/editOps.ts`) and a corrupt or missing sidecar yields an empty list rather than blocking the model. **Export bakes the edits in** — the export pipeline re-applies the same ops to the exported geometry.

> **Entity-id drift:** topology-changing ops (booleans, fillet, feature modeling) re-tessellate into new `face-*`/`edge-*` ids, so a part assignment made before such an op may no longer resolve afterwards. The tolerant parts parser drops unresolved ids on reload, so this degrades gracefully rather than erroring.

### Blank documents

**File ▾ → New Blank Model…** creates a `.brep` file holding an **empty compound** and opens it. Everything authored afterwards lives in this same `.edits.json` op-list, so a blank document is just the general "base shape ∘ ops" model with an empty base — no new concept, no new sidecar, and the CAD file stays read-only exactly as for an imported STEP.

BREP rather than STEP or IGES: a live probe confirmed all three writers accept an empty compound, so this is a preference rather than a constraint, but BREP is OCCT's native serialization, carries no unit header to declare for geometry that isn't there yet, and skips the STEP/IGES unit-detection read path. Two consequences worth knowing: the `.brep` on disk never grows (ship it together with its `.edits.json`, or Export/Save Preprocess to get something standalone), and since the export list always excludes a document's own format, a blank document's **Export…** offers STEP/IGES plus every mesh format but not BREP.

## Mesh Options Sidecar (`<model>.mesh.json`) and Generated `.geo` Script

The **FE Mesh** panel's finite-element mesh generation settings (via [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info) compiled to WebAssembly — see [GMSH Integration](./gmsh-integration.md)) are stored in a **third** JSON sidecar next to the CAD file — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.mesh.json`. Like parts and edits, this never modifies the CAD file. It is read on open (`readMeshOptions()`) and autosaved, debounced (~500 ms, its own timer), on every options change (`writeMeshOptions()`), both in `src/meshOptionsStore.ts`; parse/serialize live in the vscode-free `src/meshOptionsSidecar.ts` so they are unit-tested.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "bull.stp",
  "options": {
    "dimension": 3,
    "sizeMin": 0,
    "sizeMax": 1e22,
    "algorithm2D": 6,
    "algorithm3D": 1,
    "elementOrder": 1,
    "optimize": true,
    "stlAngle": 40
  }
}
```

An optional `budgetElements` (a positive integer) records the advisory element budget the FE Mesh panel and `estimate_mesh_budget`/`generate_mesh` warn against — it never blocks a generate and is omitted entirely when unset, so an untouched sidecar stays byte-stable. It is not a Gmsh option and never reaches the `.geo` script.

**Drawing-sheet templates** (`cad-preview-sheet-templates.json` beside the model, shared by every model in the folder; plus the bundled `dist/sheet-templates/starter-templates.json`) are `{ "version": 1, "templates": { "<name>": { "name", "description"?, "views"?, "projection"?, "paper"?, "scale"?, "title"?, "fields"?, "format"? } } }` — settings only, never geometry. Parsing is tolerant: a malformed entry or field is dropped, never the file.

**Mesh presets** (`cad-preview-mesh-presets.json`, and the bundled `dist/mesh-presets/starter-presets.json`) may carry an optional per-preset `stlExport` block — `{ "targetCellSize": 1, "chordalFraction": 0.1, "angularDeg": 20 }`, in the preset's own `unit` — the mesh-aware STL tolerance `export_tessellated_stl`'s `preset` parameter applies. A malformed block is dropped without dropping the preset.

On the same debounce, `writeGeoScript()` also (re)generates an editable Gmsh `.geo` script beside the sidecar — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.geo` — merging the source file and setting one `Mesh.*` option per `MeshOptions` field:

```
Merge "bull.stp";
Mesh.MeshSizeMin = 0;
Mesh.MeshSizeMax = 1e22;
Mesh.Algorithm = 6;
Mesh.Algorithm3D = 1;
Mesh.ElementOrder = 1;
Mesh.RecombineAll = 0;
Mesh.SubdivisionAlgorithm = 0;
Mesh.Optimize = 1;
Mesh 3;
```

**This `.geo` file is a one-way, generated **output**, not an input CAD-Preview reads back.** It exists so the mesh can be regenerated or tweaked directly in Gmsh outside the editor. Hand-edits made to it are silently overwritten the next time an option changes in the FE Mesh panel — CAD-Preview never parses `.geo` files itself. Parsing the sidecar is tolerant: a missing or hand-corrupted `<model>.mesh.json` falls back to `DEFAULT_MESH_OPTIONS` rather than blocking the panel from working.

A `sizeMax` of `1e22` is Gmsh's "unbounded" sentinel: it means "no explicit target size was ever chosen", and the webview displays it as an empty **auto** field, seeding a bounding-box-derived default (model diagonal / 20) over it in memory once the model loads. That seed is display-only — neither sidecar file is created or rewritten until the user actually changes an option in the panel.

**Exported mesh artifacts:** the FE Mesh panel's export `<select>` + **📤 Export** write further output files via a native Save dialog, in whichever format is picked — hand-written Kratos `.mdpa` (the default; either an Elements + Conditions or a Geometries layout, see [GMSH Integration § Kratos MDPA](gmsh-integration.md#kratos-mdpa-hand-written-not-a-gmshwrite-format)), GMSH's native `.msh` mesh format (nodes + elements), the legacy `.msh2` (v2.2) variant, Gmsh's fully-expanded `.geo_unrolled` script, or any of VTK/I-DEAS Universal (`.unv`)/Abaqus (`.inp`)/Nastran (`.bdf`)/SU2 (`.su2`)/INRIA Medit (`.mesh`)/STL/Diffpack (`.diff`)/OFF — see [GMSH Integration § Export formats](gmsh-integration.md#export-formats) for the full registry and which formats this WASM build actually supports. Like every other Export target in this codebase, these are save-as artifacts the user places wherever they choose; they are not sidecars and are not read back by CAD-Preview.

## View State Sidecar (`<model>.view.json`)

The persisted **camera orientation, display mode, ortho/perspective toggle, and clip plane** (roadmap "View-state persistence", closed) are stored in a **fourth** JSON sidecar next to the CAD file — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.view.json`. Like the other three, this never modifies the CAD file. It is read on open (`readViewState()`) and autosaved, debounced (~500 ms, its own timer), on every user-facing view change — camera orbit/pan/zoom/dolly, Fit/Reset, the orientation gizmo, the Ortho/Persp toggle, a Display mode button, the clip axis/offset/toggle, **or the split-view layout picker / any per-pane camera move** (Phase 2), **or collapsing/expanding a sidebar section**, **or moving the sidebar's resize handle** — both in `src/viewStateStore.ts`; parse/serialize live in the vscode-free `src/viewStateSidecar.ts` so they are unit-tested.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "bull.stp",
  "view": {
    "viewDirection": [1, 0.8, 1],
    "cameraUp": [0, 1, 0],
    "orthographic": false,
    "displayMode": "shaded",
    "clip": null
  },
  "layout": "1x2",
  "panes": [
    { "viewDirection": [1, 0, 0], "cameraUp": [0, 1, 0], "orthographic": false },
    { "viewDirection": [0, 1, 0], "cameraUp": [0, 0, 1], "orthographic": true }
  ],
  "collapsedPanels": ["meshing-panel", "standard-parts-panel"],
  "sidebarWidth": 300
}
```

`layout` (`"1x1"|"1x2"|"2x1"|"2x2"`, Phase 2 — absent/`"1x1"` = single pane) and `panes` (one `PaneViewState` per pane of that layout, row-major) are optional siblings of `view` at the file's top level, never inside `view` itself; a `1×1` session writes neither, so existing single-pane sidecars stay byte-stable. `view` stays the focused/single-pane state, so an older build reading a new sidecar still restores sensibly, and vice versa — purely additive, no version bump. Only camera state (`viewDirection`/`cameraUp`/`orthographic`) is per-pane; display mode and clip stay global, matching Phase 1's scoping.

`collapsedPanels` is a third such optional top-level sibling: the sidebar sections currently collapsed to just their header, by panel id. Valid ids come only from `COLLAPSIBLE_PANELS` (`src/webview/collapsiblePanels.ts`), and a hand-edited or newer-build list is filtered against it on read, so an unknown id is dropped rather than reaching some other element. Absent or empty (the default) means every section is expanded, so an older sidecar restores exactly as before and an untouched one stays byte-stable — again purely additive, no version bump.

`sidebarWidth` (roadmap "Sidebar layout and keyboard usability") is a fourth such optional sibling: the resizable sidebar's width in px. Read values are clamped through `clampSidebarWidth` (`src/webview/sidebarResizer.ts`, range 176..420) — a hand-edited out-of-range number falls back to the clamp bounds, never the raw value, and a non-numeric value means "unpersisted". Absent **or exactly 220** (the pre-resizer fixed width) writes nothing, so an unresized document's sidecar stays byte-stable. Same shape, same no-version-bump rule, same exclusion from the Preprocess Archive and from MCP as `collapsedPanels`.

`viewDirection`/`cameraUp` are a normalized direction (target → camera) and up vector, not a raw position/target/distance — `Viewer.frame(direction)` already re-derives both from the model's current bounding box, so this survives edits that change the model's extents. `clip.offsetFrac` is likewise a fraction of the model's bbox, not a raw plane constant — measured along the clip's **active normal**. `clip` may carry an optional explicit unit `normal` (`{axis, offsetFrac, normal?}`) which wins over `axis` when present; `axis` is still always written, set to that normal's dominant axis, so an older build restores a sensible neighbouring clip instead of none. A malformed `normal` drops only itself, leaving the clip as its axis form — unlike a malformed `axis`, which still drops the whole `clip`. Parsing is tolerant like the other three sidecars, with one stricter rule: a missing or degenerate (all-zero) `viewDirection`/`cameraUp` rejects the WHOLE record (falls back to no persisted view, i.e. the default isometric) rather than feeding NaN/zero into the camera — every other field falls back individually (an unrecognized `displayMode` → `"shaded"`, a malformed `clip` → `null`, an unknown `layout` → ignored as `"1x1"`, a bad per-pane entry → falls back to `view`'s own direction/up/ortho for that pane, a short/long `panes` array → padded/truncated to `paneCount(layout)`).

**Deliberately excludes explode-preview state** — that's a session-only interaction preview by design (`src/webview/explodePreview.ts`); the *committed* `explode` edit op already persists correctly via `.edits.json`. **Deliberately excluded from the Preprocess Archive** (below) — unlike parts/edits/mesh options, view state is purely a display/session preference with no effect on computed geometry, mesh output, or anything an MCP agent would need; there is also no MCP tool surface for it at all (same "genuinely a display feature, no headless equivalent" scope this codebase already applies to Markup and interactive Measurement).

## Annotations Sidecar (`<model>.annotations.json`)

User-**pinned measurements** (roadmap "Persisted, topology-anchored annotations", closed) — a "📌 Pin" action on a completed Measure-tool result — are stored in a **fifth** JSON sidecar next to the CAD file — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.annotations.json`. Like the other four, this never modifies the CAD file. It is read on open (`readAnnotations()`) and autosaved, debounced (~500 ms, its own timer), on every pin/rename/delete (`writeAnnotations()`), both in `src/annotationsStore.ts`; parse/serialize live in the vscode-free `src/annotationsSidecar.ts` so they are unit-tested. The headless MCP server has a byte-compatible counterpart in `src/mcpSidecars.ts`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "bull.stp",
  "annotations": [
    {
      "id": "ann-1234567890-1",
      "tool": "distance",
      "text": "12.5 mm",
      "anchorPoint": [5, 0, 0],
      "linePoints": [[0, 0, 0], [10, 0, 0]],
      "volumes": [],
      "surfaces": ["face-1", "face-4"],
      "lines": [],
      "points": [],
      "tolerance": { "nominal": 12, "plus": 0.1, "minus": 0.05, "measured": 12.5 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Entity ids in `volumes`/`surfaces`/`lines`/`points` are the same stable topological ids `Part` uses, and are rebound through the identical best-effort geometric matching a topology-changing edit already applies to Parts (`src/entityFacts.ts`'s `rebindPartsAcrossOps`, extended to also rebind annotations via the same shape-diff pass at no extra cost) — an anchor that can't be confidently re-matched is dropped from these arrays, the same graceful-degradation contract unresolved Part ids already have. `text`/`anchorPoint`/`linePoints` are a **frozen** snapshot of the measurement result at pin time; they are never recomputed on reopen or after an edit — only whether the annotation is "detached" (none of its anchor ids currently resolve in the loaded model) is computed live, in the webview. Parsing is tolerant like the other four sidecars: a missing/malformed field drops that one annotation entry, not the whole file.

The optional `tolerance` object (roadmap "Tolerance-band fact checks on exact measurements") records a nominal-plus-band intent from the Measure panel's inline fields: `nominal`/`plus`/`minus` are the band (a symmetric ± when `plus === minus`; both allowances ≥ 0), and `measured` is the raw numeric value frozen at pin time so the in/out-of-band colour can be re-derived on redisplay without parsing formatted text back into a number. Facts only — nothing stores a verdict; `src/toleranceBand.ts`'s shared `evaluateToleranceBand` computes it at render time (the same pure module the MCP `check_tolerance` tool uses). A malformed band drops the BAND only — the annotation survives as a plain untoleranced pin. A toleranced pin's label reads `"<text> [nominal ±band]"`, and it appears decorated the same way in SVG/DXF silhouette-export dimension glyphs. **Included in the Preprocess Archive** (below), alongside parts/edits/mesh options (roadmap "Archive integrity", closed).

## Construction Planes Sidecar (`<model>.planes.json`)

Named **construction planes** (roadmap "A named, persisted construction-plane entity", Phase 3 closed) — reusable datum planes saved from the current clip or entered numerically in the view-controls **Planes** group — are stored in a **sixth** JSON sidecar next to the CAD file — e.g. `bull.stp` → `bull.stp.planes.json`. Like the other five, this never modifies the CAD file. It is read on open (`readPlanes()`) and autosaved, debounced (~500 ms, its own timer), on every add/rename/delete (`writePlanes()`), both in `src/planesStore.ts`; parse/serialize live in the vscode-free `src/planesSidecar.ts` so they are unit-tested. The headless MCP server has a byte-compatible counterpart in `src/mcpSidecars.ts`, written by the `set_plane` tool and reported by `get_state`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "bull.stp",
  "planes": [
    {
      "id": "plane-0",
      "name": "Top datum",
      "point": [0, 0, 10],
      "normal": [0, 0, 1],
      "derivedFrom": "face-12"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Unlike every other sidecar that references geometry, a plane stores resolved vectors rather than entity ids** — so it takes no part in entity-id rebinding at all. A topology-changing edit that renumbers `face-N` and rebinds Parts and annotations leaves this file byte-identical, which is the whole point of naming a plane: it stays where it was put. `derivedFrom` records where the plane came from (`"face-12"`, `"clip plane"`, `"entered"`) for display only and is never resolved back to geometry.

`id` is `plane-N` and is **never reused** — the next is the highest existing N plus one — so deleting a plane and adding another cannot resurrect the old id under a new meaning. Parsing is tolerant like the other sidecars: a malformed entry drops that one plane, not the file; `normal` is normalized on read, so a hand-edited `[0, 0, 10]` still yields a unit vector; and a zero-length normal drops that plane, since it describes no plane at all. **Included in the Preprocess Archive** (below).

## Preprocess Archive (`.zip`)

**File ▸ Save Preprocess…** (Ctrl+Alt+S) packages the CAD source file plus whichever of its sidecars — `<model>.parts.json`, `<model>.annotations.json`, `<model>.planes.json`, `<model>.edits.json`, `<model>.mesh.json` — currently exist on disk into a single `.zip`, so the whole working state of a document can be shared, archived, or moved as one file. Which pieces are included is purely file-existence-driven: a document that never had meshing options set simply has no `.mesh.json` in the archive — this is normal, not an error. Pending debounced sidecar writes are flushed immediately before packaging (the same flush **Save** triggers), so the archive always reflects the current in-editor state, not a stale on-disk one. The generated `.geo` script is deliberately **not** packaged (see below).

The archive's internal layout (built by the pure, vscode-free — but Node-only, never imported by the webview — `src/preprocessArchive.ts`, shared by the extension and the MCP server):

```
manifest.json               { "version": 2, "minimumReaderVersion": 1, "source": "bull.stp",
                               "checksums": { "bull.stp": "<sha256 hex>", "bull.stp.parts.json": "<sha256 hex>", ... } }
bull.stp                    (the CAD source, byte-identical)
bull.stp.parts.json         (only if it exists)
bull.stp.annotations.json   (only if it exists)
bull.stp.edits.json         (only if it exists)

**Archive integrity (roadmap "Archive integrity", closed).** `manifest.checksums` records a SHA-256 hex digest for every entry the writer included — cryptographic tamper-evidence on top of zip's own CRC32, which only catches accidental corruption, not deliberate tampering. `readPreprocessZip()` recomputes and compares every present entry's checksum before returning anything, throwing a clear "failed its checksum" error on a mismatch. `manifest.minimumReaderVersion` is a **forward**-compatibility gate, not a backward one: it names the oldest reader version required to correctly interpret this archive, and a reader whose own capability is older refuses to open it (rather than silently misinterpreting fields it doesn't recognize) with a clear "requires a newer version of CAD Preview" error. Both fields are new in manifest version 2; a **legacy v1 archive** (written before this feature — no `checksums`, no `minimumReaderVersion` field at all) still opens exactly as before, with checksum verification simply skipped — reading tolerantly defaults a missing `version`/`minimumReaderVersion` to `1`, never inventing the current version the way an earlier build's `parseManifest` used to (a real, if minor, gap this closed: nothing ever compared the invented value against anything, so a hypothetical future format bump would have loaded silently misinterpreted).

**File ▸ Load Preprocess…** (Ctrl+Alt+O) is the inverse: pick a `.zip`, then pick a destination path for the restored CAD file (defaulting to the manifest's `source` filename, beside the archive), and CAD-Preview writes the source bytes plus every sidecar the archive contains — named to match the chosen destination, not the archive's original filename — then opens the result. Mesh options (if present) are re-written through the normal `writeMeshOptions`/`writeGeoScript` path, which regenerates `.geo` fresh from them — the archive never packages a raw `.geo` text to restore verbatim in the first place, since neither reader ever did anything with one when it was still packaged (pure dead weight, closed alongside the integrity work above). **The destination's file extension is checked against the archive's own source format** (roadmap "Archive integrity", closed) — restoring a STEP archive to `restored.stl` now fails with a clear error instead of silently succeeding; a same-format alias (`.stp`/`.step`) still compares equal, since both route to the same `FileRoute.format`. Loading an archive never touches the CAD file it was originally saved from — it always creates a separate file at the chosen destination.

The headless MCP server exposes the same behavior as `save_preprocess`/ `load_preprocess` (see [MCP Server](mcp-server.md)), sharing the identical `preprocessArchive.ts` build/read logic — an archive saved from the extension loads via the MCP tool and vice versa.

## Simulation Handoff Manifest (`<mesh>.handoff.json`)

Written beside an exported FE mesh when you ask for one (the FE Mesh panel's **Handoff manifest** box, or `export_mesh`'s `manifest: true`). It is a **receipt**, not a document sidecar: nothing reads it back when the model opens, and deleting it changes nothing. `check_handoff_manifest` compares it with the current files.

```json

}
```

- **`replay.fingerprint`** is a SHA-256 of the full edit history plus the save watermark, so adding, removing, editing or baking an op makes the manifest stale.
- **`meshOptions`** are always the native-mm values; a unit conversion is recorded once, in `unit` and one note.
- **Coverage is reported, not judged.** `status` is `resolved` (at least one physical group), `unresolved` (ids given, none landed in a group), or `empty` (no ids). `unassignedSurfaceTags` are Gmsh surface entities in no surface group; `overlaps` are entities in more than one group of the same dimension. Whether any of that matters is the solver setup's call.
- **Mesh-format sources** carry no Parts into physical groups (there is no entity correlation) and never bake their edits; both are stated in `notes`.
- **`subModelPart`** sizes are exactly what the Kratos MDPA writer emits (absent for hex-dominant meshes, which MDPA cannot represent).
- The group and coverage facts come from one extra, deterministic meshing pass with the same input and options as the export.

Queue-managed exports may choose a project-owned path with `handoffPath`. The manifest keeps the fields above and also publishes the shared version-1 contract fields: `exportId`, an external `source` reference with `revision`, `replayRevision`, effective `units` and `options`, `engine`/`engineVersion`, revisioned `artifacts`, named `groups`, and `boundaryCoverage`. This lets a study manager validate and attach the export without discarding CAD Preview's richer Part and kernel details.

## Export

The **File ▸ Export…** menu item (or Ctrl+E) converts the currently displayed model into a compatible format and saves it via a native VS Code save dialog. The available targets depend on the source file's pipeline (`exportTargetsFor()` in `src/exportTargets.ts`):

| Source pipeline | Export targets |
| --- | --- |
| B-rep (STEP/IGES/BREP) | its **own** format first (confirmed save-in-place), then the other two B-rep formats, **plus** STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF |
| Mesh (STL/OBJ/PLY) | its **own** format first (confirmed save-in-place), then the other mesh formats |
| Mesh (glTF) | the other mesh formats only (glTF is never offered its own format — the exporter only emits binary `.glb`, so saving in place would change container) |
| meshio++ (VTK/MED/CGNS/Exodus/XDMF/MDPA/OpenFOAM) | STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF — the displayed model is an ordinary `THREE.Object3D` by this point (see the meshio++ Bridge Formats section above), so it exports exactly like a native mesh source |

Picking the source's own format above is a confirmed save-in-place (modal data-loss confirmation, temp sibling + rename, one-deep `<model>.bak`, `bakedThrough` watermark with history preserved), not an export — meshio++ and CAD-text sources never offer their own format (no same-format writer).

**B-rep targets** are written entirely in the extension host: the source file is re-parsed with the same OCCT reader used to open it, the current edit op-list is applied (`applyEditsBRep`), then the result is handed to the matching OCCT writer (`STEPControl_Writer`, `IGESControl_Writer`, or `BRepTools::Write`) in `exportBRep()` (`src/occtService.ts`). There is no path from a triangulated mesh back to a B-rep, so mesh-sourced documents never offer STEP/IGES/BREP as a target.

**Mesh targets** are written in the webview, reusing Three.js's bundled exporters (`three/examples/jsm/exporters/`) on the `THREE.Object3D` already displayed — regardless of whether it arrived via a native loader or OCCT tessellation. The serialized result is sent back to the host over the protocol described in [Host ↔ Webview Protocol](./protocol.md) and written to disk there, since only the host can show file dialogs.

glTF export always produces a binary `.glb` file (not a text `.gltf` with embedded base64 buffers) — a single portable file, no separate buffer references to manage.

### Silhouette SVG/DXF Export

**File ▸ Export Silhouette SVG…** / **File ▸ Export Silhouette DXF…** (or the matching `CAD Preview: Export Silhouette …` commands) are a **third** export case, deliberately outside the Export… quick-pick above: they write a 2D **outline drawing** rather than a 3D model, so this is neither a B-rep target nor a mesh target and never appears in `exportTargetsFor()`'s list. The two menu items share one flow — a view quick-pick (**Current view** — the angle you are currently looking at — then Front/Back/Top/Bottom/Left/Right/Iso), then the same export-unit quick-pick every other export shows, then a save dialog — differing only in the serializer used (`src/svgSilhouette.ts` vs `src/dxfSilhouette.ts`, over the *same* segment list, so an SVG and a DXF of one view are geometrically consistent). Pressing Escape on the *view* pick cancels the export (it is the primary choice); Escape on the *unit* pick still exports at native mm, matching the existing convention.

> **It is an outline, not a dimensioned 2D technical drawing. There is no hidden-line removal.** Back-facing geometry is not drawn, but neither are interior feature edges that do not lie on a silhouette. OCCT's `HLRBRep_*` hidden-line machinery is entirely unavailable in this WASM build, and `HLRAppli_ReflectLines` — the one surviving green alternative — was probed against the live kernel and produced a strictly *worse* drawing (missing the part's holes and interior cutout), so the outline is derived from **triangle adjacency** instead: an edge is kept where its two adjacent triangles disagree about facing the viewer. That choice is also why this works for mesh sources and not just B-rep. Treat the result as a review/illustration artifact; use the Measurement tools for any dimension you need to be sure of.

| Source | Geometry the outline is derived from |
| --- | --- |
| STEP / IGES / BREP | the tessellation of the current model, **edits baked in** |
| STL / OBJ / PLY / glTF | the file with its pending mesh edits **baked in** by the headless mesh-edit replay (the viewer's own engine); the raw file bytes, with a warning, only if that bake fails |
| meshio++ (VTK/MED/CGNS/Exodus/XDMF/MDPA/OpenFOAM) | rejected — those formats never expose a triangle array back to JS |

The output is a single self-contained `<path>` — no `<style>`, no script, no external references — so it embeds anywhere. **1 SVG user unit = 1 model unit**, with the document's physical `width`/`height` given in millimetres, so a drawing exported from a native (mm) model prints 1:1 in any vector tool. Choosing a non-mm unit applies the same real coordinate scale every other export in this codebase uses, before projection. The DXF variant is minimal model-space `ENTITIES` only: chained collinear runs become `LWPOLYLINE`s and unmatched singletons stay independent `LINE`s, at 1 DXF drawing unit = 1 model unit.

**Limitation — triangle winding.** The facing test depends on consistent triangle winding across the mesh. A mesh with mixed winding (some triangles clockwise, some counter-clockwise, as some exporters and hand-edited files produce) yields spurious interior lines, because the test flips with the winding. There is no cheap, reliable way to repair winding for an arbitrary open mesh, so this is documented rather than worked around.

The same capability is available headlessly as the MCP server's `export_svg_silhouette` tool (its `format` param selects `"svg"` or `"dxf"`) — see [MCP Server](./mcp-server.md).

### DXF Import

**File ▸ Import DXF…** reads a `.dxf` file's model-space `ENTITIES` section and converts each supported entity into an existing parametric profile/curve edit op — genuinely no new geometry kernel surface. Handled: `LINE`, `LWPOLYLINE` (bulge arcs sampled), `POLYLINE`/`VERTEX`, `CIRCLE`, `ARC`, and `SPLINE` (control points); everything else (blocks, INSERT, TEXT/MTEXT, DIMENSION, HATCH, paper space) is skipped. Like SVG import, it is **B-rep sources only** — mesh files have no sketch topology to receive the imported ops — and placement follows the same simple defaults: flat in the XY plane at z=0, 1 DXF drawing unit = 1 mm, Y-up native (DXF needs no flip, unlike SVG). A poorly-scaled source is adjusted afterward with the ordinary `scale`/`translate`/`rotate` ops.

## File Size Guidance

| Format | Practical limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STEP / IGES | ~50 MB | Tessellation is CPU-bound in the extension host process |
| BREP | ~100 MB | Faster read than STEP/IGES; still tessellated |
| STL | ~200 MB | Binary STL loads fast; ASCII STL is much slower for large files |
| OBJ | ~100 MB | Parsing is text-based; large files may be slow |
| PLY | ~200 MB | Binary PLY is fast |
| glTF | ~100 MB | Depends on embedded texture size |

These are rough guidelines, not hard limits. Performance depends on vertex count after tessellation, not just file size.
