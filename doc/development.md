### Running the toolchain without `node` on `PATH` (Flatpak VS Code)

The Flatpak VS Code sandbox ships no standalone Node, and the host's `/usr/bin/node` is not loadable from inside it. VS Code's own Electron binary runs as Node, which is enough for the whole toolchain:

```sh
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 /app/extra/vscode/code --version   # prints the Node version
```

There is no bundled `npm`, so invoke the local tools by path rather than through a script name — `node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`, `node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run`, `esbuild.mjs`, `scripts/mcp-smoke/run.mjs`. Anything that spawns a `node` child (the MCP smoke harness spawns `dist/mcp-server.js`) also needs a `node` shim on `PATH`:

```sh
printf '#!/bin/sh\nexec env ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 /app/extra/vscode/code "$@"\n' > /tmp/bin/node && chmod +x /tmp/bin/node
PATH=/tmp/bin:$PATH node scripts/mcp-smoke/run.mjs
```

Playwright looks for its browsers under `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, which the sandbox
remaps, so point it at the real download instead:
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=~/.cache/ms-playwright`. With that set,
`vitest`, `esbuild.mjs`, `mcp:smoke`, `webview-test` and `docs:screenshots`
all run under this recipe.

`test:integration` is the one that does **not**. Its launcher spawns
`process.execPath` — which under this recipe is the Electron binary, not
Node — with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` deliberately deleted (see the long comment
in `test/integration/run.mjs` explaining why that deletion is required for the
spawned VS Code). The launcher therefore starts as a GUI VS Code that treats
its script argument as a file to open, and exits 0 having run nothing. Run
that suite from a normal terminal with a real `node` on `PATH`.

## Probing the WASM kernels

Many facts about this OCCT build can only be found by calling it: which overload suffix a constructor has, whether a manifest-green class actually computes, or what a method returns. `npm run probe -- <entry.ts>` bundles a TypeScript file with the same Node/CJS recipe as the shipped bundles and runs it against the real kernels, with the repo root as `extensionPath`:

```sh
npm run probe -- scripts/probe/examples/bull-counts.ts   # prints 36 faces / 98 edges
```

Scratch probes go under `scripts/probe/scratch/` (git-ignored). The harness also runs under the Flatpak recipe above (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 …/code scripts/probe/run.mjs …`), because it passes the environment through unchanged. [`scripts/probe/README.md`](https://github.com/loumalouomega/CAD-Preview/blob/master/scripts/probe/README.md) has the cleanup skeleton, the probe protocol and where a probe's result is recorded.

A second committed entry, `scripts/probe/examples/scad-load.ts` (`npm run scad:check -- <model.scad|model.csg>`), is the fast loop for *"the viewer hangs, or is just slow, on my model"* — it needs no `.vsix` repackage and no extension reload. It runs the shipped `.scad` → `.csg` conversion, prints a construct histogram (`hull×23`, `cylinder×71`, …), then builds the base shape with a **live per-construct trace**: the walk's own warnings are echoed as they happen, stamped with elapsed ms and RSS, to stdout *and* to a trace file, so a hang names the construct it hung in — the last line printed is the last thing that finished. Tessellation, edge and vertex extraction are timed separately (a model can build fine and still be unusable because `BRepIncrementalMesh` is the slow part — two different problems).

```sh
npm run scad:check -- /path/model.scad --timeout 120   # bounded: kills at 120s, prints the trace tail
npm run scad:check -- /path/model.scad --worker        # the viewer's own path (kernel client + worker)
npm run scad:check -- /path/model.scad --render        # PNGs via render_snapshot's engine
npm run scad:check -- /path/model.csg --only-hull 9    # build ONLY the 9th hull() {} block
npm run scad:check -- /path/model.csg --profile        # ms and call counts by OCCT entry point
```

A run ends with its five widest spans (and a killed run's watchdog prints the same, parsed back out of the trace file), so the expensive construct is named without anyone reading stamps. `--only-hull <n>` is the tie-breaker when the gap could be either side of a construct boundary: the trace cannot say whether the time went *inside* a `hull()` or into the boolean immediately after it, and rebuilding one hull alone settles that in seconds.

`--profile` narrows it further, to the **OCCT call itself**: it wraps every `BRepAlgoAPI_*` / `BRepBuilderAPI_*` / `BRepPrimAPI_*` / `BRepOffsetAPI_*` / `BRepMesh_*` / `GeomAPI_*` / `GC_*` / `ShapeFix_*` constructor (preserving `new`), the `Sewing.Perform` static, and `BRepGProp`'s integration statics, then prints the top entry points by total time and call count. The trace says *where* in the tree the time went; this says *what the kernel was doing* — which is how the enclosure's 280s build was attributed to 28 `Cut_3` calls (157.3s) and 17 `Fuse_3` calls (90.7s) rather than to the hulls it looked like. The same run prints the built shape's volume and topology counts, and names each post-build step before starting it, so a shape that builds fast but then stalls the mesher (a real failure mode — see the general-fuse note in `CLAUDE.md`) is attributed to the step that actually stalled.

`--timeout <sec>` re-executes the harness as a child and kills it on expiry, so a five-minute hang costs `--timeout` seconds instead of five minutes (a synchronous WASM call cannot be interrupted from inside the same process, which is why the kill is out-of-process and the trace goes to a file — stdout through a pipe loses its tail on `SIGTERM`). `--worker` calls the real `createKernelClient`/`dist/kernel-worker.js`, reproducing the viewer's `… did not respond within …ms` message verbatim. `--csg <path>` (or a positional `.csg`) skips openscad entirely, which is what makes iterating on the *load* half cheap.

The shared recipe lives in `scripts/nodeBundleConfig.mjs`, which `esbuild.mjs`, the screenshot fixture generator and the probe runner all import. Add a new WASM package to its `WASM_EXTERNALS` list once, rather than to each script.

## Regenerating Documentation Screenshots

The per-feature screenshots embedded in the docs are generated automatically — they are **not** hand-captured — so they stay in lockstep with the real UI:

```bash
npm run docs:screenshots   # runs build → fixtures → capture
```

The pipeline lives in `scripts/screenshots/`:

1. **`make-fixtures.mjs`** runs the *real* extension-host geometry pipeline in plain Node — OpenCascade tessellation + a Gmsh mesh of `examples/STP/bull.stp` — and writes the exact `geometry`/`tree`/`meshingResult`/`parts`/`edits` message payloads (plus the shared viewer DOM) to `scripts/screenshots/fixtures/` (git-ignored).
2. **`capture.mjs`** loads the shipped webview bundle (`media/viewer.js`) into a headless Chromium via Playwright, stubs `acquireVsCodeApi`, posts those fixtures so the UI shows genuine geometry (WebGL renders through SwiftShader — no display server needed), drives each panel, and writes one PNG per feature to `doc/public/screenshots/`. It also refreshes the two README hero images.

The webview DOM is shared with the real extension via `src/viewerDom.ts` (`viewerBodyHtml()`), which `provider.ts` also uses, so a UI change can never leave the screenshots showing stale markup. First run needs the Playwright browser: `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Running in the Extension Development Host

Press **F5** in VS Code (with the `launch.json` already configured) to open the Extension Development Host. This is the recommended way to test the extension end-to-end.

### Test fixtures

| Fixture | Format | What to test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/STP/bull.stp` | STEP (B-rep) | OCCT pipeline, multi-solid tree panel |
| `examples/STL/cube.stl` | STL | Three.js pipeline, basic geometry |
| `examples/OBJ/cube.obj` | OBJ | OBJ loader, default material |
| `examples/PLY/cube.ply` | PLY | PLY loader, normal computation |
| `examples/GLTF/cube.gltf` | glTF | GLTFLoader, scene hierarchy |

### Manual checklist

After any non-trivial change, run through:

1. Open `examples/STP/bull.stp` — model renders, component tree visible.
2. Open `examples/STL/cube.stl` — renders without loading the WASM.
3. Orbit, pan, zoom with mouse — smooth movement with damping.
4. Click each toolbar button: Fit, Tree, FE Mesh, and open each of the **View ▾** / **Select ▾** / **Measure ▾** / **Markup ▾** dropdowns. Use **File ▸ Export…** (or Ctrl+E) to export.
5. Use the view-controls panel: step rotate (15°/45°/90°), pan, zoom, Fit, Ctr (reset).
6. Collapse and expand the view-controls panel with ⌄/⌃.
7. Click all six faces of the orientation cube — view snaps to ±X/Y/Z.
8. Click a row in the component tree — solid highlights, others dim. Click again to deselect.
9. Click **Export** on `bull.stp` — quick-pick offers IGES/BREP/STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF (not STEP); export to each and reopen the output to confirm it round-trips. On `cube.stl`, confirm only OBJ/PLY/glTF are offered.
10. Open and close the same file several times — extension host memory stays flat (no OCCT heap leak). Repeat with export/cancel cycles.

## Build System Details

### esbuild

`esbuild.mjs` produces four bundles — three Node/CJS entry points plus the browser webview:

**Extension host** (`dist/extension.js`):

- Format: `cjs` (Node requires CommonJS)
- Platform: `node`
- Target: `es2020`
- `vscode` is marked external (provided by VS Code at runtime)
- `opencascade.js` is **bundled** (not external) — ESM is converted to CJS

**MCP server** (`dist/mcp-server.js`):

- Same Node/CJS recipe as the extension host, but its own standalone entry (`src/mcpServer.ts`) — it is not part of the extension bundle and is run directly by an MCP client (`node dist/mcp-server.js`)
- Additionally bundles `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod`, which never reach `dist/extension.js`
- See [MCP Server](./mcp-server.md)

**Kernel worker** (`dist/kernel-worker.js`):

- Same Node/CJS recipe again, entry `src/kernelWorker.ts`
- The forked child process both the extension host and the MCP server route every OCCT/Gmsh/meshio++ call through, so a hung or crashed WASM call can be killed and respawned without taking the parent process down
- Leaner than `mcp-server.js` — it needs the raw pipeline functions, none of the MCP SDK or tool-registration logic

**Webview** (`media/viewer.js`):

- Format: `iife` (immediately-invoked, consistent with webview CSP)
- Platform: `browser`
- Target: `es2020`
- Three.js is bundled

**`wasmPathPlugin`**: A custom esbuild plugin intercepts `*.wasm` imports and emits a `require('path').join(__dirname, '<name>')` CJS stub. After the bundle is written, `esbuild.mjs` copies the actual `.wasm` binary from `node_modules/` to `dist/`. This ensures the WASM is always co-located with the extension bundle.

The three Node/CJS configs take the plugin, the shared `external` list, the `import.meta.url` shim and the stamped kernel versions from `scripts/nodeBundleConfig.mjs`. The screenshot fixture generator and the probe runner import the same module, so a script-side bundle cannot fall behind the shipped ones.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` uses `"noEmit": true` — type-checking only. esbuild handles the actual compilation. Run `npm run compile` (or `tsc --noEmit`) to check types without building.

## Test Suite

Unit tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). They run headlessly — no display server or VS Code host needed.

Every test lives beside the module it covers, as `<module>.test.ts` (currently ~110 files under `src/`), so the file list is not duplicated here — it would only rot. The convention is that anything **pure** gets a unit test: the sidecar parsers, `editOps.ts`'s validation gate, the geometry/mesh math, the webview's DOM-free models. Modules that need the OCCT/Gmsh/meshio WASM or a live DOM are verified by `npm run mcp:smoke` and `npm run test:webview` instead.

Run all tests: `npm test`

Run a specific test file: `npx vitest run src/fileRouter.test.ts`

## VS Code Remote / SSH

When using VS Code Remote or SSH, the **running extension** is the installed copy in `~/.vscode-server/extensions/`, not the `dist/` directory in the workspace. Rebuilding alone won't show your changes.

To update the running extension after code changes:

1. Bump the version in `package.json`.
2. `npm run package` — produces `cad-preview-<version>.vsix`.
3. `code --install-extension cad-preview-<version>.vsix` (or install via the Extensions view).
4. Reload the VS Code window (`Developer: Reload Window`).

Also watch out for stale duplicate entries in `~/.vscode-server/extensions/` if you have installed both a published version and a local `.vsix`.

## CI Pipeline

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Two jobs:

**`build-and-test`** (every push/PR to `master`):

1. Checkout + Node 20 setup
2. `npm ci` — clean install
3. `npm run build` — bundle + type-check
4. `npm test` — unit tests (including the `doc/**` example-compile, op-coverage, and no-ordinal-roadmap-citation gates)
5. `npm run docs:build` — VitePress build, which is also the only dead-link check over `doc/**`
6. `npm run test:webview` — Playwright assertions over the real viewer bundle (under `xvfb-run`)
7. `npm run test:integration` — the host-side suite in a real VS Code (under `xvfb-run`, retried on network flakes)
8. `npm run package` — produce `.vsix`
9. `npm run compat:vsix` — assert the packaged archive holds every runtime file the kernel loaders resolve (derived from `.vscodeignore`'s carve-outs) and no dev/test file
10. Upload `.vsix` as a workflow artifact

**`release`** (only on `v*` tags):

1. Same steps as `build-and-test`
2. `npx vsce package --out cad-preview-<tag>.vsix`
3. Create a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes
4. Attach the `.vsix` as a release asset

## Compatibility corpus

`npm run compat` (`scripts/compat/`) is a table-driven sibling of `mcp:smoke`: each row of `corpus.json` opens a committed fixture, writes a mesh export from `examples/STP/block.stp` and re-opens it, or round-trips a B-rep export through `get_mass_properties` — every import format, every meshio/Gmsh export writer, compound extensions and mixed cells, against the real kernels. Known upstream limitations are rows too: they assert the current failure text and report **FIXED-UPSTREAM** (a finding to record, never a failure) when it stops failing. `--only <substring>` filters rows; the last run's table is written to `scripts/compat/last-run.json` (git-ignored). Timing stays in `npm run perf`.

It is not in CI (it runs the WASM kernels for minutes); run it before and after any kernel dependency change and diff the tables.

**Release checklist, before tagging:**

1. `npm outdated @meshioplusplus/wasm @loumalouomega/gmsh-wasm opencascade.js float-tetwild-wasm` — kernel drift is caught here, not at the next incident.
2. `npm ci` so the checkout matches the lockfile (a stale `node_modules` silently tests a different artifact).
3. `npm run compat` — update `corpus.json`'s `verifiedAt` when versions changed, and record any FIXED-UPSTREAM row in `CLAUDE.md`.
4. `npm run package -- --out cad-preview.vsix && npm run compat:vsix -- cad-preview.vsix`.

## Dependency Hygiene

Two mechanisms keep dependencies current and non-malicious, configured in `.github/`:

- **`dependabot.yml`** opens weekly PRs for outdated `npm` packages (dev-dependency minor/patch bumps grouped into one PR) and GitHub Actions versions. It also drives GitHub's native Dependabot security alerts/PRs for the `npm` ecosystem regardless of the update schedule.
- **`dependency-review.yml`** runs `actions/dependency-review-action` on every PR to `master` and fails the check (`fail-on-severity: moderate`) if the diff introduces a package with a known moderate-or-worse vulnerability, posting a summary comment on the PR.

Before adding any new **bundled** dependency (see the License section in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — anything that ends up in the packaged `.vsix`, not just a dev/build-time tool), check its license for GPL compatibility first regardless of what these two checks report, since they scan for vulnerabilities/version currency, not license terms.

**`docs`** (see `.github/workflows/docs.yml`, every push to `master`):

1. Checkout + Node 20 setup
2. `npm ci`
3. `npm run docs:build` — VitePress build
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages via `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`

## Embedding the kernel runtime

The build stages meshio++ under `dist/meshio/` and fTetWild under
`dist/ftetwild/`. Copy these directories intact beside a consuming CJS bundle;
they contain package metadata, ESM glue and self-located WASM binaries. The
shared inventory is `scripts/runtimeAssets.mjs`, used by the build and VSIX
checker. meshio++ ships only its sequential variant; fTetWild retains its
existing serial and threaded runtime files but always runs serially.

Both loaders first resolve an installed package relative to the bundle, then
try `meshio/` or `ftetwild/` beside it, then the same directories two levels
above it (KKSS's `out/cad-runtime/dist/` layout). Native dynamic import avoids
CJS conversion of ESM/top-level await. Keep the existing `import.meta.url`
shim from `scripts/nodeBundleConfig.mjs` when bundling these sources into CJS.
Import and initialization errors from a selected package are surfaced rather
than hidden by a fallback. Failed initialization can be retried.

For KKSS's separate migration: update its CAD submodule; copy
`cad/dist/meshio/` and `cad/dist/ftetwild/` into its runtime layout; remove the
`cadMeshioLoader` and `cadFtetwildLoader` aliases and shim files from both worker
builds; retain the existing Gmsh alias and import-meta shim. Its two consumers
should use the same tested meshio++ version. Run KKSS's packaged geometry and
MCP tests before shipping. This change does not modify KKSS.

## Dependency watch

`node scripts/dependency-watch.mjs` reports installed-versus-latest versions
without writing to GitHub. The Monday workflow also supports manual dispatch
and uses `--publish` to create or update one tracking issue. It monitors the
four WASM packages, Three.js and the MCP SDK, including releases beyond caret
ranges. Unchanged reports do not generate repeated updates; a current report
leaves existing issues alone. Registry errors fail the job.

After updating kernels, run `npm test`, `npm run compat`, `npm run mcp:smoke`,
then package a fresh VSIX and run `npm run compat:vsix`. The tests include real
CJS loading and geometry operations from an isolated directory with no
repository `node_modules`, for both adjacent and nested runtime layouts.
