# Example files

Fixtures used for manual verification (see the "Verify a change" section of the root `CLAUDE.md`) and referenced by unit/integration tests. One small `cube.*` fixture covers each mesh format; the `STP/` directory holds a large batch of real-world B-rep models for exercising the OCCT pipeline against varied geometry.

| Directory | Format | Extension | Pipeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`STP/`](STP/) | STEP | `.stp` | OCCT → BRepMesh (B-rep) |
| [`STL/`](STL/) | STL | `.stl` | Three.js `STLLoader` (mesh) |
| [`OBJ/`](OBJ/) | OBJ | `.obj` | Three.js `OBJLoader` (mesh) |
| [`PLY/`](PLY/) | PLY | `.ply` | Three.js `PLYLoader` (mesh) |
| [`GLTF/`](GLTF/) | glTF | `.gltf` | Three.js `GLTFLoader` (mesh) |
| [`MED/`](MED/) | MED | `.med` | meshio++ bridge (host-side, geometry + region/data-array-name visibility) |
| [`Nastran/`](Nastran/) | Nastran bulk data | `.bdf` | meshio++ bridge (host-side, geometry only) |
| [`OpenSCAD/`](OpenSCAD/) | OpenSCAD CSG | `.csg` | CSG parse → OCCT build → BRepMesh (B-rep, opaque base) |
| [`OpenSCAD/`](OpenSCAD/) | OpenSCAD Source | `.scad` | openscad binary → `.csg` → same as above |

CAD Preview also supports IGES (`.iges`/`.igs`) and BREP (`.brep`) via the same OCCT pipeline as STEP, and glTF binary (`.glb`) via the same loader as `.gltf`, but no example fixtures are checked in for those extensions. See `doc/file-formats.md` for the full format reference.

## STL / OBJ / PLY / glTF

Each mesh directory contains a single `cube.*` fixture — a minimal triangulated cube used to smoke-test the native Three.js loader path (no OCCT/WASM involved).

## MED

`two-material-tets.med` is a synthetic (not real-world) fixture: two tetrahedra sharing a face, written by meshio++'s own MED writer from a hand-built mesh with two named cell regions (`MaterialA`/`MaterialB`) and a `Temperature` point-data field — used to verify (`npm run mcp:smoke`) that `load_model`/the viewer's meshio++ import surfaces those real names via `readMeshioMetadata()`. See CLAUDE.md's "meshio++ integration" section.

## Nastran

`block-tets.bdf` is this extension's own FE Mesh export of `STP/block.stp` (Gmsh writer, `sizeMin` 2.5 / `sizeMax` 4 — 32 nodes, 60 elements: `CTETRA` + `CTRIA3` + `CBAR`). Gmsh writes a bare bulk-data section with no `BEGIN BULK` line, which meshio++ requires — the fixture deliberately keeps that shape so `npm run compat`/`mcp:smoke` pin the read-side normalization in `src/nastranDeck.ts`.

## OpenSCAD

Hand-written `.csg` fixtures (no OpenSCAD binary is needed to produce them — the format is plain text). `bracket.csg` is the clean path: cubes, a `$fn=10` faceted cylinder (real prism), a `multmatrix` translate, and `union`/`difference` — loads with no warnings, 2 solids, analytic volume 5228.88 (pinned in `npm run mcp:smoke`). `mixed.csg` exercises the `hull()` path and the warning paths: a `hull()` of a centred 4³ cube and an inscribed `$fn=12` sphere (the sphere is inside the cube, so the hull IS that cube — volume 64) alongside a `$fn=8` sphere imported analytic. `empty-difference.csg` (a `difference()` whose subtrahend contains the minuend, so the result is genuinely empty) and `empty-hull-child.csg` (a `hull()` with a child that cuts itself away) pin the empty-shape abort class: OCCT's mesher aborts the whole module on a shape with no sub-shapes, so both must load — as an empty model and as the surviving 4³ cube, volume exactly 64 — rather than taking the host down. `minimal.scad` mirrors `bracket.csg`'s shape vocabulary for the binary path — with openscad installed it converts to the equivalent evaluated tree (2 solids, same analytic volume, asserted in smoke when `OPENSCAD_BINARY` is set); without one, smoke asserts the graceful null-inventory + install-hint degradation instead. See `doc/file-formats.md`'s "OpenSCAD CSG" and "OpenSCAD Source" sections.

## STP

Real-world STEP AP203 models, mostly drawn from the public [NIST/STEP Tools AP203 test file library](https://www.steptools.com/docs/stpfiles/ap203/index.html). `bull.stp` is the primary fixture used throughout `CLAUDE.md`'s manual verification steps (parts, edits, wireframe modeling); the rest exercise the tessellation and edge pipelines against a wide range of solids and assemblies.
