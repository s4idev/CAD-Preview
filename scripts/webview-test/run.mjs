/**
 * Webview assertion harness — the automated half of `doc/roadmap.md`'s Tier 1
 * "close the F5-only verification gap".
 *
 * Drives the REAL shipped `media/viewer.js` over `viewerDom.ts`'s own markup in
 * headless Chromium (the same harness `scripts/screenshots/capture.mjs` uses —
 * see `../screenshots/harness.mjs`) and **asserts** against it. That harness
 * has existed for a long time but only ever captured PNGs, which is precisely
 * why an exit-0 run could coexist with every 3D shot being silently misframed.
 *
 * **What this can and cannot cover, stated plainly.** It covers the webview:
 * DOM, panels, picking, overlays, and the messages the webview posts back
 * (`window.__sent`, populated by the harness's `acquireVsCodeApi` stub). It
 * covers **nothing** host-side — quick-picks, save dialogs,
 * `vscode.workspace.fs`, custom-editor registration and the file watchers all
 * live in the extension host, which Playwright cannot reach at all. That half
 * is `test/integration/` (`@vscode/test-electron`).
 *
 * Every case below is tied to a REAL, documented bug or invariant from
 * `CLAUDE.md`, not to coverage for its own sake — see each case's comment.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:webview` (chains build → fixtures → this).

// ── Runner ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ── Clip plane and the stencil clip cap ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `clipCap.ts` had NO test of any kind and a documented SILENT failure mode:
// get the stencil state wrong and the model simply renders uncapped, with no
// error anywhere. These cases close that, and they gate the arbitrary-normal
// work (the "arbitrary clip planes" feature) — everything below `Viewer.setClippingPlane` was
// "already plane-generic", but that was an inference from reading the code.
//
// The lever is `main.ts`'s `case "viewState"`, which re-applies a posted view
// state after hydration straight into `clippingControls.applyState`. That
// drives the whole sidecar-shape → UI → `planeForClip` → `setClippingPlane`
// path with NO test-only production surface.
//
// TWO non-obvious things, both established empirically here rather than
// assumed, because each produced a confidently wrong result first:
//
//  1. **The camera must sit on the CLIPPED-AWAY side to see the cut.** A
//     three.js clipping plane keeps the half its normal points INTO, so
//     viewing along `+normal` shows the outside of the surviving half with
//     the cut facing away — no cap is visible and everything looks broken.
//     Every case below therefore views along `-normal`. Verified against a
//     standalone three.js scene: flipping the plane's normal is exactly what
//     turns "no cap" into "cap".
//  2. **The cap is LIT** (`MeshStandardMaterial`), so it never renders as the
//     raw `--cad-face` value, and its shade changes with orientation. Colour
//     matching is therefore by HUE, not by proximity to a fixed RGB.
