 * Extrema_ExtAlgo)` constructs but NEVER computes (no `Perform` method
 * exists; `IsDone()` stays false and `DistValue()` echoes the `dst`
 * early-exit hint verbatim regardless of filled bounding boxes or flag),
 * and its other overloads need `BRepExtrema_ShapeType`, which is NOT bound;
 * (2) `DistShapeShape_2(S1, S2, extFlag, extAlgo)` accepts the (bound!)
 * `Extrema_ExtFlag_MAX` silently but ignores it — always returns the
 * minimum. So this function reports the minimum exactly, plus the additive
 * context fields below; a caller wanting "how far apart overall" has
 * `centreDistance`.
 *
 * **`kind: "edgeLength"`** — reuses the exact `BRepGProp.LinearProperties`
 * call shape `getEntityFacts` above already verified (single-edge only, per
 * that function's own doc comment — never call it over multiple edges).
 *
 * **`kind: "radius"`** — only valid for an edge whose underlying curve is a
 * true circle: `BRepAdaptor_Curve_2(edge).GetType()` compared symbolically
 * against `oc.GeomAbs_CurveType.GeomAbs_Circle.value` (never a hardcoded
 * literal, so this stays correct regardless of the enum's actual numeric
 * value in a given build) — then `.Circle()` returns a `gp_Circ`-like
 * handle, `.Radius()` the exact radius. **Verified end-to-end against the
 * live WASM**, not just that the calls don't throw: a cylinder primitive
 * added via `addCylinder(radius: 3, ...)` and re-measured through this exact
 * path (`apply_edit_ops` → `measure_exact`) resolved its rim edges' radius
 * as exactly `3`, and an unrelated circular edge already present in
 * `bull.stp` resolved to a plausible `2.5399999999998477`. A non-circular
 * edge (line, B-spline, ellipse, …) throws a clear, actionable error rather
 * than silently returning a meaningless "best-fit" number.
 *
 * **`kind: "angle"`** — the angle between two entities' DIRECTIONS
 * (`measureDirectionOf` above: a planar face's plane normal, or a straight
 * edge's line direction), `0…180`, plus `lineAngleDeg` (`min(value, 180 −
 * value)`, `0…90`) which is the orientation-independent reading of the same
 * pair. Needs `entityIdB`, and either side may be a face or an edge in any
 * combination — a face and an edge is a legitimate "how is this edge inclined
 * to that face" question. A non-planar face, a curved edge, a solid or a
 * point refuses by name rather than reporting a meaningless number.
 *
 * **`lineAngleDeg` exists because the raw angle genuinely cannot answer "are
 * these two parallel?" — measured, not assumed** (probe:
 * `scripts/probe/scratch/exact-angle.ts`, which is also where `curve.Line()`
 * → `.Direction()` was confirmed bound). On `examples/STP/block.stp`, a real
 * 3×4×5 box: `face-0`/`face-1` (the two opposite x-faces) report the SAME
 * normal, so their raw angle is **0°**, while `face-2`/`face-4` (the opposite
 * y-faces) report **antiparallel** ones, so theirs is **180°** — both pairs
 * parallel, both directions arbitrary, and the arbitrariness differs WITHIN one
 * solid. The same holds for edges (`edge-0`/`edge-2` = 180° while
 * `edge-1`/`edge-5` = 0°). Perpendicular pairs are unaffected: every
 * perpendicular face/edge pair on that box reads exactly 90°. So the stored
 * direction of a face or edge is whatever OCCT's `gp_Pln`/`gp_Lin` happens to
 * hold — which is why `value` is reported exactly as the directions give it
 * (the same `acos` of the unit dot the interactive viewer's Measure tool
 * already computes from its picked normals/tangents, so the two agree whenever
 * the two directions agree) and `lineAngleDeg` is published beside it for the
 * question the raw number cannot answer.

/**
 * Best-effort entity-id rebinding across an ARBITRARY op-list change —

 * "entity-id drift" gap CLAUDE.md documents: a topology-changing op
 * re-tessellates into fresh ids, so a `Part` referencing the old ones used to
 * just lose them. Originally append-only (roadmap "Entity-id drift", first
 * closed); generalized here (roadmap "Extend entity-id rebinding to
 * `remove_edit_op` (and undo/redo)", closed) to handle ANY `oldOps -> newOps`
 * transition, not just a strict-prefix append.
 *
 * **Two strategies, chosen by shape of the change — NOT one uniform
 * algorithm, after a genuine correctness bug was found the hard way against
 * the live WASM.** `oldOps`/`newOps` share a longest common prefix
 * (everything before the first differing op — identical content, nothing to
 * rebind there).
 *
 * - **Pure append** (`oldOps` a strict prefix of `newOps`) or **pure
 *   truncation** (`newOps` a strict prefix of `oldOps` — undo, or Clear
 *   dropping to `[]`): incremental PER-OP stepping, one shape-diff per
 *   topology-changing op, walking forward (append) or backward (truncate)
 *   one op at a time from the common prefix. This is the original
 *   append-only algorithm (and its exact mirror for truncation) — small,
 *   precise geometric deltas at every step, since only ops genuinely being
 *   added or removed from the END of the list are ever involved.
 * - **General change** (anything else — most notably `remove_edit_op`
 *   splicing out of the MIDDLE of the stack, which is neither a pure append
 *   nor a pure truncation): ONE direct whole-shape fingerprint-and-match
 *   between `shape(oldOps)` and `shape(newOps)`, no intermediate steps.
 *   **This is deliberately NOT decomposed into per-op incremental steps —
 *   verified the hard way that doing so is actively WRONG, not just less
 *   precise.** An earlier version tried "unwind `oldOps` down to the common
 *   prefix by popping from the end, then rewind up to `newOps`" (the natural
 *   generalization of the two safe cases above) and it corrupted a real
 *   scenario end-to-end (`npm run mcp:smoke`): removing an EARLIER op
 *   (`addBox`) from `[addBox, addSphere]` while a Part was assigned to the
 *   LATER, entirely-unrelated `addSphere`'s own face. Since `addSphere` sits
 *   at the raw END of `oldOps`, "pop from the end" pops it FIRST — which
 *   means, from the algorithm's narrow per-step view, the sphere doesn't
 *   just move, it **disappears entirely** for the two intermediate steps in
 *   between, and a geometric nearest-neighbor match correctly (from that
 *   narrow view) finds no match for it in a shape where it genuinely isn't
 *   present yet — dropping a Part reference that should never have been
 *   touched at all, since the sphere is identical, unmoved geometry in both
 *   the real `oldOps` and `newOps` shapes. A single direct match between the
 *   two FINAL shapes has no such blind spot: every entity that's actually
 *   unchanged (the common case for anything not near the edit) keeps an
 *   identical fingerprint in both, so nearest-neighbor matches it correctly
 *   regardless of where in the op list the actual change happened to be.
 *   The trade-off accepted for this case: a larger geometric "jump" between
 *   the two shapes than the incremental steps give the safe cases, which
 *   could in principle produce a less confident match right at the entities
 *   the actual change *did* affect — judged the right trade for a
 *   correctness-first MVP over a fancier (and still not obviously complete —
 *   a later op can depend on an earlier removed one's output) common-prefix
 *   *and*-suffix decomposition.
 *
 * Both strategies reuse `collectAllEntitySignatures`/`rebindEntities`/
 * `remapPartEntityIds`; a cheap pre-check (no WASM touched at all) skips the
 * whole function when neither `oldOps` nor `newOps`, from the first
 * differing op onward, contains anything in `TOPOLOGY_CHANGING_OPS` — ids
 * are already stable in that case, so paying for even one shape-diff would
 * be pure waste. Returns the ORIGINAL `parts`/`annotations` arrays (same
 * references) in that case, or when `oldOps`/`newOps` are identical or both
 * `parts` and `annotations` are empty — so callers can cheaply check
 * `result.parts === parts` (and `result.annotations === annotations`) to
 * skip a sidecar write.
 *
 * The match tolerance is `1e-3 * bboxDiagonal(shapeAfter)`, the same
 * tolerance-fraction convention `gmshPartsMap.ts`'s geometric bbox-centre
 * matching and `modelDiff.ts`'s solid matching already established.
 *
 * `annotations` (roadmap "Persisted, topology-anchored annotations", closed)
 * is an OPTIONAL 7th parameter, defaulting to `[]` — it rebinds a persisted
 * `Annotation[]` list through the EXACT SAME shape-diff pass already run for
 * `parts`, reusing the same computed `idMap` at zero extra OCCT cost (an
 * `Annotation` is structurally an `EntityIdBag` too, see its doc comment in
 * `protocol.ts`), rather than requiring a second, independent
 * `readShape`+`applyEditsBRep`+`collectAllEntitySignatures` round trip. Every
 * pre-existing call site is unaffected: omitting the parameter defaults it to
 * `[]`, and `remapPartEntityIds([], idMap)` is a no-op.
