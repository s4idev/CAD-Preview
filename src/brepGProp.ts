/**
 * The single shared entry point for OCCT's ADAPTIVE (eps-driven) `BRepGProp`
 * integration overloads — roadmap item "Mass properties may be using the
 * under-integrating `BRepGProp` overload", closed.
 *
 * **Why adaptive.** `BRepGProp`'s fixed-order quadrature under-integrates
 * faces trimmed by fitted B-spline pcurves — which is what a large fraction
 * of real imported STEP is made of. FluidCAD (the comparison project this
 * finding came from) measured ~7% volume error on real geometry because of
 * it. This codebase measured the disagreement directly against the live WASM:
 * on `examples/STP/bull.stp`, fixed-order gave 178421.48 vs adaptive 178448.05
 * at eps=1e-3 (**+0.0149%**) and 178454.45 at eps=1e-4 (+0.0185%) — small but
 * real, directionally consistent with under-integration, and exactly the
 * confidently-wrong-number failure mode `get_mass_properties`,
 * `compare_models`'s `volumeDeltaPct`, `check_interference`'s overlap volume,
 * `meshHeal`'s healed-volume delta, and `xcafTree`'s fingerprint volumes all
 * feed on.
 *
 * **Binding provenance, verified against the live build** (not assumed from
 * the manifest): stock opencascade.js ships `BRepGProp.hxx.patch`, which adds
 * `VolumeProperties2`/`SurfaceProperties2`/`VolumePropertiesGK2` — renamed
 * adaptive variants that exist purely because embind cannot disambiguate an
 * overload on `Standard_Real Eps` from one on `Standard_Boolean`. Probed:
 * all three are bound statics on `oc.BRepGProp`, and both used here work —
 * `VolumeProperties2(box, props, 1e-3, false, false)` fills `props` with the
 * 2×3×4 reference box's exact 24 (no regression vs the fixed-order overload's
 * own verified value), and `SurfaceProperties2(shape, props, eps, skipShared)`
 * takes exactly 4 args in this binding.
 *
 * **These two wrappers' RETURN VALUE is NOT the integral — read `props`.** The
 * binding hands back the `Eps` argument it was handed (probed: a 10 mm cube,
 * the enclosure's `hull()` solid and an empty compound all return exactly
 * `1e-3` = `MASS_INTEGRATION_EPS`, while `props.Mass()` gives 1000 / the
 * correct volume / 0). Every call site in this codebase is a bare statement
 * followed by a `props.Mass()` read, which is why the vestigial return has
 * never mattered — but a probe or a new caller that trusts it measures the
 * epsilon instead of the geometry and reports a plausible-looking `0.001` for
 * a perfectly good solid. The return type stays `number` for signature
 * stability.
 *
 * Every volume/surface integration site in the codebase goes through these
 * two wrappers so the eps and argument order can't drift between them
 * (`LinearProperties` is unaffected — edge length is not surface-quadrature).
 * Pure and WASM-free (the resolved `oc` module is passed in), so importing
 * this module introduces no kernel-service dependency cycle.
