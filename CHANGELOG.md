# Changelog

All notable changes to the "CAD Preview" extension are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/); this project does not yet strictly follow Semantic Versioning (pre-1.0 releases moved fast and bundled multiple features per bump).

## [3.6.5] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- **OpenSCAD `.csg`/`.scad` imports now leave a much lighter document behind.**
  A same-domain cleanup pass (`ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain_2`) runs on each
  boolean result, so the moulded enclosure imports with **1312 faces instead of
  2745** — its bottom tray with 187 instead of 1085, which is also the face count
  the Components tree, the Parts picker and face selection have to work with.
  Everything downstream follows: tessellation 1.31s → 0.72s, edge extraction
  290ms → 167ms, and roughly half as many objects in the 3D view. Volumes are
  unchanged to within 3e-9 relative; the pass is volume-guarded, `IsNull`-guarded,
  wrapped in `try`/`catch` and skipped below 256 faces.
- Shape volumes are now memoized by handle, removing repeated `GProp`
  integration (47 `VolumeProperties2` calls → 41 on that model).

### Fixed

- **Corrected a `Sewing` flag that would have been silently wrong.** The 5-arg
  `BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing` ctor's first flag (`sewing=false`) is 2.45× faster and
  still reports a correct free-edge count — but `SewedShape()` comes back *empty*,
  so a closure gate reading `NbFreeEdges() == 0` would have accepted a shell that
  was never sewn. Probed, documented, not used.

### Notes

- **A 3.2× faster import was implemented, measured, and removed again — the
  geometry it produced was not the geometry the design describes.** Merging each
  coplanar group of a facet solid's triangles into one face (a geometry-preserving
  reduction: same vertices, same planar region, same winding) cut the enclosure's
  build from 19.4s to 5.5s, because the booleans then intersect far fewer faces.
  It also made this OCCT build fail to glue a coplanar face-to-face contact: the
  tray came back 5.451mm³ light, with two detached 2.725mm³ tabs and two
  zero-volume 2-face sheets — 14 solids where the design has 10 — while the total
  volume stayed exact, so nothing downstream noticed. Four remedies were measured
  and all failed: exact-only merge tolerances (identical result), unifying the
  solid after sewing instead of the facets before it (identical result),
  `SetGlue` (`GlueShift` left six sub-1mm³ slivers, `GlueFull` collapsed the model
  to 7772mm³), and re-fusing the detached pieces afterwards (`done=true`, still
  two solids). `BRepAlgoAPI.SetFuzzyValue`, the standard remedy, is **not bound**
  in this build. The import therefore stays on triangulated facets — correct, and
  18.7s rather than 5.5s. Use
  `npm run probe -- scripts/probe/examples/csg-solid-inventory.ts <model.csg>` to
  see a model's per-solid decomposition before trusting any such change.
- GPU acceleration was investigated for this pipeline and is not available: OCCT's
  B-rep booleans are CPU-bound comparisons with no GPU path in `opencascade.js`
  (and WebGL/WebGPU cannot evaluate B-rep intersections). The webview's rendering
  was already GPU-driven; what the display actually paid for was the object count,
  which is what the cleanup pass above now halves.

## [3.6.4] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **OpenSCAD `.csg`/`.scad` imports are 12.9× faster, and the model no longer trips the
  kernel watchdog.** A moulded enclosure (23 `hull()`, 71 `cylinder()`, 123 `multmatrix`,
  2 `difference()`, 1 `union()`) took 280s to build — more than the 300s kernel timeout
  allowed for IPC and display prep, so opening it failed with
  `"loadBRepCachedForDocument" did not respond within 300000ms`. Profiling by OCCT entry
  point showed 88% of that build was the pairwise boolean fold: **157.3s in 28 `Cut_3`
  calls and 90.7s in 17 `Fuse_3` calls**, each step re-processing an accumulator that had
  already grown to the size of the finished part. The same model now loads in 22s.
  - The union and the difference are each **one `BRepAlgoAPI` per node**, driven by
    operand lists (`Fuse_1`/`Cut_1` + `SetArguments`/`SetTools` + `Build()`).
  - `multmatrix` now keeps analytic surfaces: rigid, uniform-scale and mirrored matrices
    take `gp_Trsf` + `BRepBuilderAPI_Transform_2` instead of `gp_GTrsf` +
    `BRepBuilderAPI_GTransform_2`, which was converting every transformed cylinder to a
    BSpline approximation (volume 125.658588 instead of the exact 125.663706 on a test
    cylinder) and handing those patches to the booleans. Shear and non-uniform scale still
    use the general transform.
  - Both fast paths fall back to the previous pairwise fold — visibly, with a warning —
    when a call throws, reports `IsDone() === false`, or fails a volume bound, so a
    rejected optimization cannot ship a wrong shape silently.
- **Booleans no longer silently drop operands.** The old union fold lost 4 of the
  enclosure's 18 operands on coplanar touches; the multi-operand form merges all 18. The
  volume moves 32064.75 → 32047.38 mm³ against OpenSCAD's own 32109.77, and a rendered
  comparison against the pre-change images differs in 0.11% of pixels at 20% colour fuzz,
  all of it thin edge lines — no feature, hole or silhouette change.
- **Stale Nastran import expectations corrected (tests and docs only).** `npm run mcp:smoke`
  still pinned a `Not a meshio++-C++ Nastran file` failure for a Gmsh-written `.bdf`, a
  limitation meshio++ 16.x had already removed once `BEGIN BULK` normalization was added —
  so a full smoke run could not pass. The block now asserts real geometry, matching the
  `load-bdf-gmsh-export` row in `scripts/compat/corpus.json`, which already expected a
  successful load and remesh (verified: `nastran · remesh 1255 el`). `doc/file-formats.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md` and the roadmap's Nastran item said the same stale thing and were corrected.

### Added

- **OCCT call profiling in the probe harness**: `npm run scad:check -- <model> --profile`
  reports time and call counts by OCCT entry point (booleans, transforms, mesh, the
  gprop statics), which is what located both causes above. The harness also reports the
  built shape's volume and topology and names each post-build step as it starts.

## [3.6.3] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **OpenSCAD `.csg`/`.scad` imports no longer lose most of the model.** A real two-piece
  enclosure rendered as a handful of loose fragments — 8415 mm³ against OpenSCAD's own
  32109.77 — because of two independent defects in the CSG walk, both only reachable on a
  model with real booleans:
  - A `union()` whose fuse silently lost geometry on a coplanar touch bailed out by handing
    the next boolean a compound of 18 overlapping solids. It now leaves that one operand out
    and keeps fusing, so the union stays a single well-formed solid and the loss is local
    and reported (`union() — N of M operand(s) could not be combined and were left out`).
  - A `cut` raising a C++ exception (surfacing as `___cxa_can_catch is not defined`, since
    this OCCT build ships no Emscripten exception runtime) unwound to the importer's top
    level and replaced the **entire part** with an empty compound. A failing cut is now
    contained to itself, and a faulting subtree no longer costs its siblings.

  The same enclosure now comes out at 32064.75 mm³ against the 32109.77 oracle (−0.14%),
  with its bounding box matching exactly.
- **An empty result no longer aborts the kernel.** `tessellateShape` was missing the
  empty-shape guard its sibling `tessellateByGroup` already had; OCCT's mesher does not
  throw on a shape with no sub-shapes, it aborts the whole WASM module. Reachable from a
  `hull()` whose child is a `difference()` that cut itself away, and from any `.csg` that
  evaluates to nothing.

### Added

- **OpenSCAD `hull()` support.** `hull()` was skipped as having "no OCCT equivalent", which
  for a hull is not approximation but deletion — it *replaces* its children, so 23 skipped
  hulls left a top-level `difference()` with no minuend at all. A pure-TypeScript convex hull
  (`src/convexHull.ts`) is computed over the children's tessellated vertices, which is both
  forced (a cylinder has only two seam vertices) and exactly OpenSCAD's own semantics (it
  hulls the faceted polyset, not an analytic surface). A 2-D `hull()` is still skipped with a
  warning rather than emitted as a flat face where a solid belongs.
- `examples/OpenSCAD/empty-difference.csg` and `empty-hull-child.csg`, pinning the
  empty-shape abort class in `npm run mcp:smoke`.

### Changed

- The extension's display name is `CAD Preview @s4idev` in this local build. Versions
  3.6.1–3.6.2 were local re-build bumps with no user-visible change.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Embedded kernel runtime loading.** meshio++ and fTetWild runtime files are staged beside the CJS bundles, and their loaders resolve either installed packages or the staged layout used by embedded applications.
- **Weekly dependency watch.** A scheduled workflow checks OCCT, Gmsh, meshio++, fTetWild, Three.js and the MCP SDK, and creates or updates one issue when versions trail npm.

### Changed

- **meshio++ upgraded from 16.7.0 to 16.16.0; MCP SDK upgraded from 1.30.0 to 1.30.1.** Compatibility checks retained MED, CGNS and GiD metadata fallbacks, while the new meshio++ release fixes mixed-topology XDMF remeshing.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Headless mesh-edit replay.** Edits made to a mesh-format model (STL, OBJ, PLY, glTF, or a meshio++ import) used to replay only in the viewer, so every headless tool saw the raw file. They are now baked by the same engine the viewer uses, so `generate_mesh`, `export_mesh`, `compare_mesh_refinement`, `measure_mesh_deviation`, `compare_models`, the drawing tools and `CAD Preview: Export Mesh` all mesh, compare and draw the edited model. A translated cube's exported mesh now moves by the translation.
- **`save_model` accepts STL, OBJ and PLY sources.** It bakes the pending edits into the file in its own format, keeps a one-deep `<model>.bak`, and records the save point, exactly as it does for STEP, IGES and BREP. glTF is still refused, because its exporter only writes binary `.glb`.

### Changed

- Where these tools used to warn that pending mesh edits were "NOT baked in", they now report the facts: `Baked N of M pending mesh edit op(s)`, plus one line for each edit that could not apply, with its index, kind and reason. If the bake itself fails, meshing falls back to the raw file and says why; `save_model` throws before writing anything.
- Mesh loading is shared between the viewer and the kernel worker (`src/webview/meshObject.ts`), so `node-N` edit targets mean the same object in both.
- `doc/roadmap.md` task IDs were renumbered after the headless mesh-edit replay item closed (section 2 is now `2.1`–`2.8`); headings keep their anchors, so existing links are unchanged.

### Not yet baked

Mesh `inspect`, `get_mass_properties` and `measure` (their ids are defined over the raw file), `promote_mesh_to_brep`, `repair_mesh`, and the inspection sections of the preparation report still read the raw file, and their responses say so.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Refinement sweep in the FE Mesh panel.** A collapsed **Refinement sweep** section meshes the same model at several explicit sizes and shows nodes, elements, time and quality per run, with a note that density and quality trends do not establish solver convergence. It can write one `.msh` per run into a folder you pick, and **Copy TSV** copies the table. The panel and the `compare_mesh_refinement` MCP tool now run the same loop.
- **Copy hole table.** A Parts-header button copies the hole schedule (`generate_hole_table`'s TSV) for B-rep sources.
- **Free-text notes.** Right-click a face, edge or point and choose **Pin note…** to pin a short note, saved with the other annotations and baked into drawings as a label. `pin_annotation` accepts notes too.
- **Export FE mesh from mesh-format sources.** `CAD Preview: Export Mesh` now works for STL, OBJ, PLY, glTF and meshio++ sources, not only B-rep ones.

### Changed

- **Roadmap tasks are numbered.** `doc/roadmap.md` gives every item a task ID (`1.1`, `2.3`, `4.10`) in its heading and in the order tables, and its sections are numbered 1–6. IDs are renumbered at each planning review, so code and other docs still cite items by name; every heading keeps an explicit anchor, so existing links are unchanged.
- The KKSS source build renders `render_snapshot` images from its bundled MCP worker.

### Fixed

- Planar (2D) Kratos MDPA export now writes surface cells as Elements and curve cells as Conditions, with line boundaries, instead of the 3D layout.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **B-rep health report.** A new `check_brep_health` MCP tool and a **B-rep Health** panel (Advanced ▸ Analysis) report OCCT's own validity checks over the edited model: per-solid, shell, face and edge statuses (for example `UnorientableShape`, `NotClosed`), open-boundary edges, and loose wireframe edges, each tied to the entity ids the rest of the tool uses. Hovering an issue row highlights it in the viewer. It is read-only and repairs nothing, and it is an explicit action rather than something run on open (the analyzer alone takes about 9 s on a 2.3 MB STEP file).
- **Nastran `.bdf` import.** Bulk-data decks open as a triangulated boundary through meshio++ (routed as the `nastran` format), including the Gmsh-style decks this extension itself exports, which carry no `BEGIN BULK` line and are normalised on read. `.bdf` is an ambiguous extension, so opening one shows a status note saying it is assumed to be a Nastran mesh.
- **Probe harness.** `npm run probe -- <entry.ts>` bundles a TypeScript entry against the real WASM kernels and runs it under Node, so live-kernel findings can be reproduced instead of living in throwaway scripts. The Node/CJS bundling recipe is now shared in `scripts/nodeBundleConfig.mjs` by the extension, MCP server, kernel worker, screenshot fixtures and the probe runner.

### Changed

- **Relicensed from `GPL-2.0-or-later` to `GPL-3.0-or-later`.** `LICENSE` now carries the verbatim GPLv3 text, and `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, the README's Licensing section, the docs footer and the PR template match. Nothing bundled today requires more than `GPL-2.0-or-later` (Gmsh's own licence is still compatible with either); the change is made ahead of the "Build and bundle an OpenSCAD WASM port" roadmap item, because a real OpenSCAD build links CGAL (GPLv3-or-later / LGPLv3-or-later) and/or Manifold (Apache-2.0, GPLv3- but not GPLv2-compatible), which forces a `GPL-3.0-or-later` floor. Doing it now avoids a second licence change when that dependency lands. Versions already released remain available under `GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **meshio++ upgraded from 10.21.1 to 16.7.0.** Integer point and cell data arrays now arrive from the WASM as `BigInt64Array`, which would silently break region-to-Parts correlation and integer colour fields if left unconverted, so they are converted on read. meshio++'s new native header-only metadata scan under-reports regions and data arrays for MED, CGNS and GiD files, so those three read metadata from a full read instead.
- The mesh handoff manifest now states plainly whether boundary coverage was checked. Physical-group coverage is reported as unavailable for mesh-format sources, and manifest notes are reported as warnings.

### Fixed

- `getGmshVersion` always returned "Gmsh version unavailable", because gmsh-wasm returns `option.getString` as an object rather than a bare string; both shapes are now read. Nothing consumed it yet (handoff manifests use build-stamped package versions), so no exported output was ever wrong.

### Documentation

- `doc/roadmap.md` is restructured into upkeep, ready work, probe-gated items grouped by area, and strategic bets. It gains a meshing-library review (MMG remeshing, meshio++ field transfer, untapped Gmsh features), a kernel-capability review, an ecosystem review, a note on what the relicense unlocks, and about thirty new evidence-backed items; the OpenSCAD WASM port replaces the old "Bundling `openscad-wasm`" Non-goal, and the CGAL Non-goal is reworded since its licence reason no longer applies.
- Two stale entries in the Known limitations list are corrected: hidden-line removal exists through **Export Technical Drawing**, and tessellation runs in the forked kernel worker, not in the extension host.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Owned FE-mesh jobs.** The webview assigns one request UUID per Generate/Export; the extension host and the standalone MCP server attach stable owner/request IDs to the serialized kernel queue. Cancelling removes only that owner's queued work or terminates only its active worker call.
- **Durable mesh execution receipts.** Queue-managed `export_mesh` writes an atomic, versioned receipt before dispatch and exposes owner-checked `cad_job_status` / `cad_job_cancel`. After a restart, a receipt with no live kernel record reports `uncertain` and is never replayed automatically.
- **Versioned mesh handoff manifests** produced by the mesh export path.

### Changed

- The FE Mesh panel's Cancel button is hidden when there is nothing to cancel, and the mesh action row stays usable in narrow panels.
- A cancelled mesh export no longer writes its output file.

### Fixed

- The packaged `.vsix` now contains only CAD runtime assets.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-23

Eleven items closed, all headless-side or additive, plus two correctness fixes to how the kernel and the sidecars behave under concurrent access — no sidecar schema changes, no breaking MCP changes.

### Added

- **Meshing preparation tools.**
  - **Mesh-aware surface tessellation export** (`export_tessellated_stl`, and Export ▸ STL ▸ *Mesh-aware…*): derives the B-rep tessellation's linear deflection from a downstream target cell size instead of the viewport, and reports the sampled chordal error against the requested tolerance.
  - **Mesh size and memory budget preview** (`estimate_mesh_budget`, and a readout in the FE Mesh panel): a calibrated element-count/memory estimate from real volume/area, before you generate.
  - **Narrow-gap and passage resolution preflight** (`analyze_passages`, and a Passages panel under Advanced ▸ Analysis): finds annular passages between coaxial cylinders and thin slots between facing planes, reports cells-across against the requested size, and can apply a suggested local size as a Part.
  - **CAD-to-mesh deviation map** (`measure_mesh_deviation`, and a *Deviation* button in FE Mesh): samples distance from the CAD tessellation to the generated mesh boundary in both directions, with per-face failures and an optional PLY export carrying the distance field.
- **Drawing-sheet settings and reusable templates.** Title block fields (author, drawing number, revision, material), a `template`/`libraryPath` pair on `export_drawing_sheet`, `save_sheet_template`/`list_sheet_templates`, and a small webview form replacing the sheet export's two quick-picks.
- **Batch export** (`batch_export`, and a *Batch Export…* command): exports many files to one target in one run, with a per-file result row — a bad file becomes a failed row, never an aborted batch — and a read-only report panel.
- **Simulation handoff manifest** (`export_mesh {manifest: true}`, a *Handoff manifest* checkbox in FE Mesh, and `check_handoff_manifest`): a receipt beside a mesh export recording the source and edit-history hashes, resolved Part→physical-group mapping, boundary coverage, Kratos SubModelPart sizes, and the kernel versions used, so a later call can tell whether the export has gone stale.
- **Preparation report bundle** (`generate_prep_report`, and a *Preparation Report…* command): a self-contained HTML (plus JSON) report assembling mass properties, BOM/hole table or mesh health, mesh quality, deviation, passage findings, budget-vs-actual, and the handoff manifest — each section filled by the same tool an agent would call directly.
- **Dependency and format compatibility corpus** (`npm run compat`): a table-driven suite covering every import format, every meshio export writer, and known upstream limitations, plus a packaged-extension content check (`npm run compat:vsix`) now run in CI.

### Changed

- **Kernel jobs are now scoped to their owner** (a document tab, an MCP request, or a batch run). Cancelling one no longer risks killing another's in-flight kernel call; a queued-but-not-yet-sent job is dropped without ever reaching the kernel. There's a per-call timeout and a `cadPreview.kernelTimeoutMinutes` setting.
- **External sidecar/source changes while you have unsaved local edits now prompt** ("Reload from disk" / "Keep mine") instead of silently overwriting whichever side wrote last. A source-file replacement with unsaved edits pending prompts the same way instead of reloading unconditionally.

### Fixed

- **`compat:vsix`'s first run found two packaging leaks**: `scripts/reinstall-local.sh` and roughly 1,200 stray `.opencode/**` files were being included in the packaged `.vsix`. Both are now excluded.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-21

A ground-up redesign of the viewer's chrome. No CAD, meshing, MCP or file-format behaviour changed — every sidecar, tool and export reads and writes exactly what it did in 2.7.0 — but nearly everything you look at is different, and one control moved (see **Changed**), which is why this is a major version. It also covers the `2.7.1` version bump that was never released.

### Added

- **Status bar.** A full-width strip along the bottom of the window: **kernel readiness** (`OCCT ready · Gmsh ready`), entity counts (`36 faces · 98 edges · 64 points`), the generated FE mesh (`mesh 10,000 el · min SICN 0.412` — hover it for the node count) and the live cursor position on the model (`x 110.18  y 31.75  z 51.29 mm`, following the Units dropdown). Kernel readiness is inferred from calls, so a document that never needs a WebAssembly kernel — a plain STL open, say — honestly reads `Kernels idle`; a kernel shows *ready* only after a call that needed it has succeeded, and goes back to idle if the worker is cancelled or restarts.
- **Document chip.** The menu bar shows the open file, a format badge and, when the document has edits not yet saved into the source file, a dot and the count (`3 unsaved edits`).
- **Selection pill.** Selecting an entity shows a one-line summary (`face-0 · planar · 8,119.27 mm²`) with the full fact rows behind a disclosure arrow.
- **An icon on every sidebar section**, and line glyphs on the toolbar, dock and section headers, all theme-adaptive.
- **Components search.** The filter box is behind a search button in the header; Escape closes it and clears the filter. Assembly rows show how many solids they hold.
- **Edits count badge** beside the section title, so the history length reads while the section is collapsed; the FE Mesh header shows the element count once a mesh exists.
- **Preset highlighting.** The Coarse / Medium / Fine button nearest the current element size reads as selected.

### Changed

- **The sidebar is reorganised.** The four sections that edit the document (Components, Parts, Edits, FE Mesh) stay at the top; the read-only analysis sections and the two library sections fold into one collapsible **Advanced** group. The default sidebar width grew from 220 to 272 px.
- **Parts rows are compact:** swatch, name, a `1 · 0 · 0` count and an eye. The assign (＋) and delete buttons appear when you hover or focus a row, and entity lists start collapsed. **A part's target mesh size is no longer edited in the Parts panel — use FE Mesh › Part sizes.** The stored value is unchanged.
- **FE Mesh layout.** A full-width Generate button; the element-size readout above the slider; presets as a segmented control; Engine and Preset side by side; and the export row (format · unit · Export) closing the panel. Part-size fields are plain text fields, so `4.0231` reads `4.02` rather than following the OS locale.
- **Toolbar and dock.** The toolbar was inheriting the browser's 16px font and is now sidebar-sized, with a divider between the plain buttons and the menus. The floating dock is one compact row with icon navigation, text-only display modes and the collapse control at its end; the controls used less often sit behind a **⋯** popover.
- **A selected face keeps its Part colour** with a subtle tint; it used to turn lilac because the accent glow was added at full strength.
- **Colours follow your VS Code theme** throughout the chrome; only the model's own colours come from the separate scene palette.

### Fixed

- **Three view-control elements rendered even when they should be hidden:** the construction-plane midplane row and the Colour-by-field group and legend. An author `display` rule beat the `hidden` attribute, so they showed for every document instead of only when applicable.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Saved view bookmarks.** Named camera bookmarks (orientation, display mode, clip plane) persist per document in `<model>.view.json`; save, restore, replace, rename, and delete them from the View menu.
- **Reusable meshing presets.** Named `MeshOptions` bundles with explicit units and a pinned engine (`save_mesh_preset` / `list_mesh_presets` / `apply_mesh_preset` MCP tools plus a Saved presets section in the FE Mesh panel), backed by a bundled starter library (`mesh-presets/starter-presets.json`).
- **Measured mesh-refinement comparison.** New `compare_mesh_refinement` MCP tool meshes the same model at several explicit sizes and compares cost vs quality (nodes/elements, elapsed time, quality summary, TSV output) before choosing one via `applyIndex`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-09-20

Closes the last two Tier 1 roadmap items: all of Tier 1 is now empty, so the tier is dropped from `doc/roadmap.md` per its own rule.

### Added

- **Resizable sidebar.** A drag handle (also a keyboard-operable `role="separator"` button: ArrowLeft/Right step, Home/End jump) resizes the sidebar between 176 and 420 px; the width persists per document in `<model>.view.json` (`sidebarWidth`, omitted at the 220 default so untouched sidecars stay byte-stable).
- **View-controls placement.** The floating control bar is centred over the 3D canvas instead of the whole editor pane (the old position covered the sidebar's bottom panels at ordinary window widths), capped to the app region with row-wrapping at narrow editor sizes.
- **Keyboard usability.** Dropdown menus gain roving ArrowUp/Down/Home/End navigation and Escape closes while returning focus to the trigger; every icon-only control gets a screen-reader `aria-label`; Parts/Variables/plane inline renames commit on Enter and cancel on Escape — which also fixed a real defect where the planes rename's Escape path committed the half-typed value anyway.
- **GitHub issue and PR templates** (closes #30). Bug/feature forms carry the contributing guide's fields (VS Code/extension/OS, format + size, repro steps, a non-confidential fixture) and a "what were you doing?" surface selector; the PR template mirrors the repo's verification and docs-sync conventions.
- **Roadmap-citation gate.** `npm test` now fails on a new bare-ordinal `roadmap item N` citation (`src/docRoadmapRefs.ts`); every existing positional citation was rewritten to carry the feature name.

### Changed

- **`decompose_to_primitives` tool description** now names the feature and issue #34 instead of a roadmap item number.
- **`mcp:smoke` hardening.** The defeature block's ambient WASM-abort-prone calls now go through the established `callWithCleanRetry` convention (a read-only no-op-reset variant for `load_model`).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- **Standard-parts thumbnails.** Search results in the Standard Parts panel now show a 48 px thumbnail beside the part text, fetched lazily by the host and delivered as `data:` URLs. Text stays the fallback; the checksum-verified STEP download path is untouched.
- **Author profiles on a named construction plane.** Circle/rectangle/polygon profile forms gained a Plane picker: choose a `plane-N` and the sketch is placed from the plane plus in-plane offsets (and rotation for rectangle/polygon). Changing a plane moves everything referencing it; deleting one freezes last-good caches.
- **Per-band operation-preview colouring.** The draft op's own produced faces now read distinctly from retained context: two-tone per intent (bucket faces saturated, context desaturated grey) with a status-line legend.
- **Volume and point selection predicates.** `Select ▾` filters now cover all four pick modes: volumes (`Size ≥/≤`, `Center ±X/±Y/±Z`, `Largest/Smallest N` by bbox volume) and points (`Near XY/XZ/YZ`, `Near selection`, `In selection box`).
- **Zoom to selection.** `Select ▾` grew a Zoom to selection button plus a `cad-preview.zoomToSelection` command, framing the current selection in the focused pane.
- **Bounded assembly interference checks.** `check_interference_all` (and the Clash panel's Check-all) accept `maxPairs`/`maxBooleans` budgets; pairs past the budget return as `unchecked` placeholders that are never reported as clash-free.

### Changed

- **Minimum supported VS Code engine raised to `^1.137.0`** to match `@types/vscode`.
- **Dependency updates.** `three`, `three-mesh-bvh` 0.9.15, `zod` 4.6.5, plus dev-dependency refreshes.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-17

Closes two more Tier 1 roadmap items — clip-cap visibility tracking and save/reopen/recovery regression coverage — plus assembly-tree group rows and a generated SVG icon set.

### Added

- **Clip caps follow visibility.** Hiding or isolating a Part (or a Components-tree/assembly group) now rebuilds the stencil-buffer cross-section instead of leaving a stale cap painted; mesh/color overlay toggles ride the same coalesced path. Target collection uses `traverseVisible` so a hidden ancestor's whole subtree is excluded. Covered by new `clip V1–V3` pixel cases in `test:webview`.
- **Assembly-tree group rows select and hide their descendant solids.** Clicking or eye-toggling a synthetic `Assembly N` header expands to its descendant `solid-N` leaves instead of doing nothing.
- **Save, reopen and recovery regression coverage.** Twelve new integration cases in a real VS Code host drive the Ctrl+S join, modal cancellation, a second save (watermark `1→2`, one-deep `.bak`), reopen stability (with a forged-watermark double-apply control), Save As copy + cross-format refusal, revert-to-watermark, hot-exit backup round trip, source-write and watermark-write failure injection with rollback + retry, dirty-sidecar pre-check refusal, save-time Part/annotation rebinding, and STL save-in-place.
- **In-memory `vscode` stub for unit tests** (`src/vscodeStub.ts`, vitest-only alias) with headless `customBackup` coverage — no unit test had ever imported `vscode` before.

### Changed

- **Toolbar/panel icons are generated SVG** (theme-adaptive, `currentColor`-based) instead of hand-maintained sources.
- **Save hardening.** Both bake paths fail fast on a dirty edits sidecar before any write or modal, and roll the source back to its pre-save bytes when the watermark write throws after the source was rewritten — the pair agrees again instead of double-applying on reopen; the documented recovery is simply saving again.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-15

Closes the roadmap Tier 1 tier: headless mesh inspection, hole-to-hole axis distance, plus the hole table, starter macros, drawing sheets, SVG import, CSG extrudes, and distance-graded mesh sizing.

### Added

- **Multi-view drawing sheets.** File ▸ Export Drawing Sheet… and the MCP tool `export_drawing_sheet` place several views (default front/top/right/iso) on one SVG or DXF sheet at a shared scale, orthographically aligned per first-angle (ISO, default) or third-angle (ASME) projection, inside a frame with a title block. `paper: "fit"` sizes the sheet to the content at 1:1 (or an explicit `scale`); a named ISO paper size (A4–A0) picks the largest ISO 5455 standard scale that fits. A pinned annotation is drawn once, in whichever orthographic view shows it at true length.
- **Headless mesh mass properties, inspect and measure.** `get_mass_properties`, `inspect`, and `measure` now serve STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF headlessly via a shared triangle integration (volume/area/centroid/`watertight`, raw file coordinates) — no analytic parameters, no moments of inertia. `load_model` returns a `meshEntities` inventory with discoverable `mesh-component-N` / `mesh-triangle-N` / `mesh-vertex-N` ids (deliberately not the webview's `node-N` object ids) and warns when pending mesh edits are not baked in. `measure_exact` stays B-rep-only.
- **`axisDistance` on `measure_exact`.** For two cylindrical faces, the shortest infinite-axis separation (hole-to-hole spacing) is reported alongside the finite-surface clearance — pure vector math over the already-verified cylinder accessors, zero new kernel surface.
- **Hole table / feature schedule.** New `generate_hole_table` MCP tool: one row per (diameter, axis-direction) group of cylindrical faces with the nearest standard designation and signed delta, plus a TSV string for spreadsheet handoff.
- **Bundled starter macro library.** `macros/starter-library.json` ships `spring`, `bolt-circle-flange`, and `hex-bolt` parameterized starters, served when `libraryPath` is omitted; the interactive Macros panel lists the bundled rows read-only.
- **SVG import.** File ▸ Import SVG… and the `import_svg` MCP tool parse `<path>`/`<rect>`/`<circle>`/`<ellipse>`/`<line>`/`<polyline>`/`<polygon>` with full ancestor-transform composition into `addPolyline` ops; multi-loop selections build one holed face via `addSurfaceFromLines`.
- **OpenSCAD `.csg` extrude coverage.** `polygon`/`square`/`circle` profiles with `linear_extrude` (incl. centered, twist/scale refusals) and `rotate_extrude` (full/partial angles) now build instead of skipping with a warning.
- **Distance-graded mesh sizing anchored on a Part.** `Part.meshGrading` (`sizeAtWall`/`sizeFar`/`distNear`/`distFar`) drives a Gmsh `Distance`+`Threshold` field pair (B-rep sources only), composed with per-part `meshSize` under one `Min` background field.

### Fixed

- **Technical drawings with pinned annotations were misaligned.** `export_technical_drawing`'s hidden-line engine returned coordinates in a model-centred frame while the dimension-glyph renderer worked in world coordinates, so a pinned dimension's glyph was offset from the geometry it measured by the model's own bounding-box centre. Fixed as part of the multi-view sheet work, since a sheet needs every view in one shared frame to align them at all.
- **DXF technical drawings and silhouettes were mirrored vertically** when opened in a real (Y-up) CAD viewer — every coordinate was written with the wrong sign for DXF's Y-up convention.
- **A raw OCCT exception pointer (no message text at all) could escape the kernel-fault detector unwrapped**, leaving the WASM singleton corrupt with no reset and no actionable error. `isOcctWasmAbort`'s vocabulary (and its siblings in the Gmsh/meshio++/fTetWild services) now also recognizes a bare all-digit exception message.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **Dependency updates.** `@meshioplusplus/wasm` 10.20.2 → 10.21.1, `vitest` 4.1.11 → 5.0.0, `@types/node` 26.4.0 → 26.5.0, `@types/vscode` 1.134.0 → 1.136.0, `playwright` 1.62.1 → 1.63.0. Minimum supported VS Code engine raised to `^1.136.0` to match `@types/vscode`.

There are no user-facing changes in this release.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-10

Closes Tier 0 in full (mesh save-in-place + headless `save_model`) and adds the interactive counterpart of primitive recognition/decomposition.

### Added

- **Tier 0 Phase 3 — mesh save-in-place + headless `save_model`.** STL/OBJ/PLY now offer their own format first in File ▸ Export… as a confirmed save-in-place (modal data-loss confirmation, temp sibling + rename, one-deep `<model>.bak`, `bakedThrough` watermark with history preserved; the webview's mesh replay consumes only the tail after the save point, so no double-apply; glTF stays excluded since its exporter only emits binary `.glb`). Headless gains a `save_model` MCP tool (STEP→STEP, IGES→IGES, BREP→BREP only — mesh/meshio/CAD-text refused): bakes the unbaked op tail into the source itself, keeps the full history with the watermark, leaves a `.bak`, and rebinds Part/annotation ids across the save. Every other writer still refuses the source via `assertNotSourcePath`.
- **Primitive-recognition panel.** The interactive counterpart of `recognize_primitives` / `decompose_to_primitives` (previously MCP-only): a new Primitives sidebar section classifies B-rep solids with candidate type + fit residual, applies the emitted variable-bound ops onto `EditsModel` (undoable op-by-op), and exports the result to STEP/IGES/BREP or saves the emission as a macro. Unrecognized solids report their face inventory with a reason — facts only, never a guess. Zero kernel work (both pipeline functions were already `Pipeline` keys).

### Fixed

- **Dependabot alerts for hono and js-yaml** resolved via overrides.
- **Roadmap item numbering** updated for clarity and consistency.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-09

The major bump marks Tier 0: documents are now genuinely editable — the read-only invariant is narrowed to "never written silently" (every source write stays an explicit, confirmed action). All four Tier 2 headless↔interactive symmetry items also close in this release.

### Added

- **Editable documents (Tier 0, Phases 1–2).** Picking the source's own STEP/IGES/BREP format in File ▸ Export… is now a confirmed write back to the open document, and `Ctrl+S` bakes the unbaked op tail into it. A `bakedThrough` watermark on the edits sidecar keeps the full history visible while replaying only the tail; undo/remove/jump refuse to cross the save point, `File: Revert File` drops back to the watermark, Save-As copies source + sidecars, and hot-exit backs up both. Part/annotation ids are rebound across the save via a two-byte replay. Headless is unchanged (`assertNotSourcePath` still refuses). Mesh-format in-place save stays a later phase.
- **Mesh-operations panel for meshio sources.** The FE Mesh panel grew a Mesh ops section driving the existing `runMeshioOps` pipeline entry (clean/decimate/smooth/subdivide/refine/agglomerate/convertCells, one per Run) over VTK/MED/CGNS/… sources, writing a new file in the source's own format. No new kernel surface.
- **`inspect_meshio_fields` MCP tool.** Headless per-array facts (name, point/cell location, component width, finite-only min/max, NaN count) for meshio++ sources — summaries only, never raw values; multi-component arrays report their width. Read-only.
- **`pin_annotation` MCP tool.** Headless create + delete over the annotations sidecar (fail-fast structure, accept-and-warn anchors incl. mesh `node-N` ids) — closes end-to-end headless dimensioned drawings via `export_technical_drawing`.
- **BOM "Copy" button.** Parts-header action copying one TSV row per part (via a new `bomRequest` round trip over the existing `computeBom` kernel surface), enabled only for B-rep sources with ≥1 part.
- **Clash panel.** Part-vs-Part interference checks (single pair + check-all over `checkInterference`/`checkInterferenceAll`) as a sidebar section over the `massPropertiesRequest` message shape. Zero kernel work.
- **Mesh auto-decimate.** `check_mesh_health`/`promote_mesh_to_brep` accept `autoDecimate` for meshes over the 50,000-triangle ceiling (meshio++ quadric edge-collapse to ~1,000 triangles, resampling stated in the response, never silent); degenerate heals are reported/skipped, never promoted as wrong solids.
- **Defeature op.** Remove a recognized feature (fillet band, chamfer) by face selection via `BRepAlgoAPI_Defeaturing`, healing the solid behind it — B-rep only, topology-changing.
- **Hex-boundary region correlation.** `convertToStlBoundaryWithRegions` triangulates quad boundaries (verified provenance-preserving) instead of bailing to the plain path, so hexahedral volumes keep their region→Parts correlation.

### Fixed

- **`repair_mesh` unit tests now cover the stored-options pipeline arg** (the 5th `repairMesh` parameter never made it into the assertions — the only CI failure on the release branch).
- **OpenSCAD `.scad` conversion resolves relative paths** (a live-binary run caught argv carrying a relative caller path while `cwd` was already the source dir, so every relative `load_model` failed to open the input).

## [1.13.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Wrap sketch onto cylinder/cone (`wrap` edit op).** Develops a flat sketch face onto an analytic cylinder or cone target (true surface development — length-preserving, not projection), then thickens it symmetrically along the surface normal. Three variants: **Standalone** appends the wrapped shell as a new solid, **Emboss** fuses it into the target volumes, **Engrave** cuts it out. Available in the Edits panel's feature composer, through `apply_edit_ops` / `run_parametric_script` for agents, and recorded in the op history with per-op replay outcomes and classification buckets like every other topology-changing op (B-rep only).
- **Loft guide rails (`guides` on the `loft` op).** A loft between two closed sections can now be steered by a guide-rail wire — captured in the Edits panel with **Set rail** on one or more Line-mode edges, or passed as `guides: edgeId[]` through `apply_edit_ops` / `run_parametric_script`. The rail's lateral deviation from its own endpoint chord offsets resampled intermediate sections, which are then lofted through the same `ThruSections` builder as an unsteered loft. This is deliberately **not** the kernel's own rail wiring — `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell`'s guide API is unreachable in the bundled OCCT WASM build — so it is named as a resampling fallback everywhere it appears (the op docs, the panel row, the history label's `+rail` suffix) rather than presented as a kernel feature. Scoped to exactly two closed sections and no wall thinning; the rail's edges are never consumed and stay in the model, like a sweep's path. B-rep only.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **New Blank Model button in the Models view toolbar.** The Models view title bar now offers **Open…**, **Refresh**, and **New Blank Model…** — starting an empty session no longer requires an empty workspace (the welcome-view link), the Command Palette, or the webview File menu. Both `cad-preview.open` and `cad-preview.new` also gained explicit toolbar icons (`$(folder-opened)` / `$(new-file)`), since title-bar buttons without icons don't render inline. The creation flow itself is unchanged (save-first `.brep`, refuses to overwrite).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **Integration suite (`npm run test:integration`) no longer fails in CI.** Two independent harness defects, both fixed without touching product code: the test VS Code now launches with `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader`, because CI's GPU-less xvfb box left the webview's three.js renderer without WebGL2 — the webview module died before posting `ready`, so the blank-model `geometry` assertion failed with an empty log (`saw []`) rather than a real error; and the test window now opens with a workspace folder plus a fresh per-run user-data dir, because a window starting with no workspace at all never delivers `updateWorkspaceFolders` to the extension host (the call returns `true` yet no event ever fires), which flaked the Models-view case, while the previously reused profile accumulated dead workspace roots across runs.

There are no user-facing changes in this release.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **New Blank Model — start with no source file.** **File ▾ → New Blank Model…**, the `CAD Preview: New Blank Model…` command, and a second button in the Models view's welcome all create an empty `.brep` document and open it, so the Edits panel's whole creation vocabulary (primitives, 2D sketch profiles, bottom-up wireframe modeling, booleans, fillets, patterns) can be used from scratch rather than only on top of an existing model. A blank document is an ordinary B-rep document whose source is an empty compound: everything you author lives in the replayable `<model>.brep.edits.json` op-list exactly as it does for an edited STEP, and the CAD file stays read-only. It refuses to overwrite an existing file rather than blanking a model whose edit history would then replay against nothing. Export bakes the geometry into a standalone file.
- **Collapsible sidebar sections.** Every sidebar section — Components, Parts, Edits, FE Mesh, Mass Properties, Mesh Health, Region fit, Macros, Standard Parts — now has a chevron in its header that collapses it to just that header, independently, so the panel can be reduced to what you are actually using. Collapsing one of the two space-filling panels (Parts, Edits) hands its space back to the rest. The layout is remembered per document in the existing `<model>.view.json` sidecar (`collapsedPanels`, a purely additive field — an older sidecar restores exactly as before, and an untouched one stays byte-stable).

### Fixed

- **The Mesh Health and Region fit panels were visible for every source format**, including B-rep files where they have nothing to show. Both panels carried an unconditional `display: flex` rule, which beats the `hidden` attribute's effect, so the source-format eligibility check that was supposed to hide them was inert. They now appear only for a native STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF source, as documented.
- **An empty shape no longer crashes the OCCT kernel.** Handing a shape with no sub-shapes to `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh_2` aborted the whole WebAssembly instance — a hard fault, not a recoverable error — leaving every later operation in that session failing until the extension host restarted. Tessellation now returns an empty result for such a shape instead. Reachable from any edit that reduces a model to nothing (a boolean that cuts the last solid away, or undoing past the last op that produced geometry), as well as from the new blank documents above.
- **The Region fit and Standard Parts panel headers rendered unstyled** — neither matched any rule in the stylesheet. All nine sidebar headers now share one class instead of a hand-maintained id list that had already drifted.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **`package-lock.json` no longer pins a nonexistent `ipaddr.js@1.9.2`.** The v1.9.2 version bump was applied as a blanket `1.9.1` → `1.9.2` text replacement, which also rewrote the only other place that literal appeared in the lockfile: the `ipaddr.js` entry and `proxy-addr`'s pinned dependency on it. That version has never been published (the registry goes 1.9.0 → 1.9.1 → 2.0.0), so `npm ci` failed with a 404 for every consumer and every CI job. The entry is back at `1.9.1` — the version its unchanged integrity hash always described; no dependency actually changed.

There are no user-facing changes in this release.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **Release job no longer loses the whole release to a Marketplace outage.** v1.9.0's `vsce publish` step failed on a transient HTTP 503 from `marketplace.visualstudio.com`, and because that step sat upstream of "Create GitHub Release", the tag was left with no release and no `.vsix` attached even though the build itself was fully green. The publish step now retries with backoff (matching the existing precedent for `update.code.visualstudio.com`), the PAT is passed via the `VSCE_PAT` environment variable instead of a `-p` flag so it never appears in the child process's argv, and the release step runs unconditionally on non-cancellation so a Marketplace hiccup can no longer cost the GitHub release.
- **`package-lock.json`'s embedded root-package version brought back in sync** with `package.json` — it had silently lagged one release behind since the v1.9.0 bump.

This release republishes v1.9.0's full changelog (below) unchanged; v1.9.0 itself never reached the Marketplace.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Selector synthesis — persist a re-executable query instead of a positional entity id.** New `resolve_selector` and `synthesize_selector` MCP tools plus `targetQueries`/`targetQueryKinds` op annotations: a bucket query re-derives its producing op's recorded faces and re-matches them geometrically on every replay, a scene query filters/ranks the whole current model, and stale indices freeze instead of repointing (kind-tag guard) rather than silently resolving to the wrong entity. Parts carry the same mechanism (`Part.selector`, resolved on open and after every op-list change), and the Edits panel's extrude/revolve/shell/draft forms gained a **Pin query** row that synthesizes a query for the selected face through the same kernel path. Mesh sources replay on cached ids (no query resolution without exact topology), and queries are refused inside `repeat` bodies.
- **Rib feature op.** `rib` builds a thin-walled rib from an open spine sketch: wall extruded along `dir` until it meets the planar terminator `upTo` (plus one wall-thickness of embed so the contact penetrates for fusing), fused into the surrounding solids with debris-tolerant operand splitting, and the wall↔body junction blended at `blendRadius` (`0` = fuse only). `thin` is required and symmetric (`thinOuter` must be absent or exactly half, since an open wire has no inside/outside).
- **Extrude up-to-face terminator.** `extrude` accepts `upToFace` (a planar face) instead of `length`: the extrusion runs from the profile plane to the terminator plane along `dir`, derived with plain plane math (miss/parallel/non-planar skips gracefully). Thin-wall handling, start-cap identity, and bucket roles behave identically for both forms.
- **Loft smoothing.** `loft` accepts an optional strict-boolean `smoothing` through the shared loft-wires choke point (plain, open-band, and outer/inner-thin paths alike) — the only `ThruSections` knob with a measured effect in this build (`-0.64%` on the progressively-twisted 4-section fixture; continuity/parametrization/max-degree settings are accepted by the kernel but change nothing, so they stay unexposed). Omitted/`false` replays exactly like before.
- **Region pick + drill.** `extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep` take an optional `pick` narrowing which enclosed regions of a multi-region profile are consumed — region `0` is the outer boundary, `1..N` its inner loops in order: omitted (or `"outer"`) keeps the face as modeled with holes preserved, `"all"` (or any list containing `0`) fills every hole, and a list without `0` builds each picked inner loop as a standalone island body. Out-of-range indices skip with a diagnostic naming the loop count; an explicit `pick` refuses `thin`, and `loft`/`rib` reject `pick` at validation. The new `drill` op cuts the same picked regions through target solids — one prism per region down an explicit `dir` × `length`, subtracted from the targets. B-rep only, with a Regions row on the extrude/revolve/sweep forms and a Drill composer in the panel's Modify category.
- **Models activity-bar view.** A CAD Preview icon in the lateral bar lists every CAD/mesh file in the open workspace folder(s) — same routing rules, depth cap, and `.git`/`node_modules` exclusions as the headless `list_workspace_models` tool, over `vscode.workspace.fs` so it also works on Remote/SSH. Click a file to open it in the 3D viewer; the title bar offers the same **Open…** dialog plus **Refresh**, and file create/delete refreshes the tree automatically. With no folder open, or no models found, the view shows an **Open CAD File…** button instead.
- **Per-step generated screenshots for the tutorials.** The docs pipeline now tessellates each tutorial's cumulative op-list prefixes from `block.stp` (fused and finished bracket, patterned tools and finished flange, sketch/extruded/shelled enclosure, plus the finished bracket meshed at the FEA page's own size) and captures one shot per step — every tutorial step finally shows its own part instead of reusing the generic panel screenshots.

### Changed

- **`npm run docs:build` now also runs in CI** (one step after unit tests): the VitePress build is the only dead-link check over `doc/**`, which previously waited for the push-to-master docs workflow — a broken intra-doc link reached `master` before anything noticed. Deploy still lives in `docs.yml`.
- **New doc-coverage gate in `npm test`.** Every live op kind must now be named somewhere in `doc/**` (exact backticked/quoted token or `"op"` value — bare prose doesn't count), no op-position snippet may claim a removed kind (the rename-catcher), and the committed `doc/op-coverage-allowlist.txt` must contain no rotted opt-out. Its first run found a real gap (`rib` was documented nowhere user-facing) rather than passing clean.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Thin-walled features.** `extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep`/`loft` accept an optional `thin` (total wall thickness) to build a thin-walled body — a tube, a hollow of revolution, a walled sweep or loft — instead of a filled one, plus `thinOuter` for how much of that wall sits outside the profile boundary (`0`, the default, grows it entirely inward; `thinOuter === thin` entirely outward; anything between straddles the outline). The profile's outline is offset into a band before the ordinary builder runs, so the result is an ordinary solid in every other respect; unlike a plain feature, a thin one does **not** consume its profile sketch, so the sketch stays available to reuse. A profile that already has a hole is refused rather than silently losing it, and a wall thicker than the profile's own narrowest half-width is skipped with an explanatory diagnostic. Both fields are ordinary numeric op fields a parametric variable can drive.
- **Open-profile (wire) operands for the same four ops.** `extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep`/`loft` can now build from a set of picked **edges** (`profileEdges`/`profileEdgeSets`) as well as a sketch face — closing the "closed face profiles only" limitation thin-walled features shipped with. A closed edge selection behaves like the equivalent face; an **open** edge chain (an open polyline's own segments, for instance) requires `thin` and produces a walled body whose ends are rounded off, since an open profile encloses no area to fill. The interactive panel gained **Set path** (sweep) and **Add section**/**Clear** (loft) capture buttons so the profile-vs-path and per-section ambiguity that a wire operand introduces can be resolved by clicking, the same way boolean operand A is already captured.
- **Three new narrative tutorials** under `doc/tutorials/` — building an L-bracket (primitives, booleans, fillets, holes), a shelled enclosure from a 2D profile sketch (extrude + shell), and preparing a part for finite-element analysis (naming regions, mesh refinement, exporting to Kratos MDPA) — each with numbered steps and a compiled, gated "Full operation list" block.

### Fixed

- **Three transitive dependencies carrying published high/moderate-severity advisories** (`fast-uri`, `nanoid`, `qs`, pulled in via `ajv`/`postcss`/`express`) bumped to their patched versions via `package.json` overrides; none of the three ship in the packaged `.vsix` (they're build/dev-time only), so this closes the alerts without any runtime behavior change.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Explain the geometry under the cursor.** Hovering a face/edge/vertex shows a tooltip with its id and which edit ops mention it; selecting one opens an inspector card with the facts that actually apply to that shape — a plane gets its normal and a point on it, a circular edge its radius, and a row that would be blank is simply absent rather than empty. Right-clicking an entity offers **selection groups** built from the same predicate vocabulary the Select ▾ filters use — "same facing", "planar faces", "area ≥ this" — with each row's match count shown up front, and any group that would match only the entity you clicked omitted as pointless.
- **A macro library — saved, named, parameterized scripts.** A parametric script (the existing `{variables, steps}` document with its `repeat` loop and expression evaluator) can now be saved under a name and re-run later with different parameter values: `save_parametric_script`, `list_parametric_scripts`, and `run_saved_script` over MCP, plus a **Macros** panel that can save the ops you have already applied and re-run them with edited parameters. A script's own `variables` block *is* its parameter list — there is no second schema — and a macro that compiles to no ops is refused at save time rather than failing later against a real model. Running one pushes its ops onto the normal edit stack, so a macro is undoable and removable op-by-op exactly like a hand edit.
- **Hole Wizard — standard tapped and clearance hole presets.** ISO metric coarse/fine and UNC/UNF sizes, available as `list_standard_hole_sizes` and as a designation dropdown on the three hole ops that fills the existing radius/depth fields. Every diameter is in millimetres (imperial designations included, with the inch size carried separately), and each designation reports **two** diameters — tap-drill and clearance — as facts rather than one recommendation, since which applies depends on intent.
- **Camera-aware snapshots, and `hit_test` — the pixel → entity loop closed.** `render_snapshot` gained a 14-view vocabulary (six cardinal plus all eight isometric octants), an orbit offset from any of them, and an optional composite that stitches the tiles into one image rather than spending several. `screenshot_shape` frames a single entity — isolating it by default, because a face framed at its own scale usually puts the camera inside the parent solid. `hit_test` fires rays and reports the entity struck, with the point and (for a face) its normal: the inverse of `render_snapshot`, which previously had no counterpart. It runs host-side with no browser at all, so unlike the render tools it has no unavailable path.
- **2D technical drawings with hidden-line removal** (`export_technical_drawing`, and **File ▾ ▸ Export Technical Drawing…**) — feature edges with occluded runs dashed, in SVG or DXF, for B-rep *and* mesh sources. Visibility is computed exactly rather than sampled: under orthographic projection both an edge's depth and an occluding triangle's plane-depth are affine in the edge parameter, so each crossing is solved in closed form — there is no sample spacing to tune and no thin occluder to step over. This works on tessellated triangles and calls no OCCT hidden-line API, which is why it exists at all: that kernel machinery is entirely unavailable in this WebAssembly build.
- **Tolerance-band checks on exact measurements.** A pinned measurement can carry a nominal and plus/minus allowances, rendered as a real dimension in the 3D view — arrowheads, witness lines, the value — and baked into SVG/DXF exports (on a separate `DIMENSIONS` layer in DXF). `check_tolerance` reports the measured value, the signed deviation, and whether it sits inside the band, as facts rather than a pass/fail verdict.
- **Arbitrary clip planes, derived from geometry you can see.** The Clip group is no longer limited to X/Y/Z: **Face** clips along a selected planar face and **3 Pts** through three selected points, with a fourth `N` segment that keeps the derived normal selectable so you can flip to an axis and back without re-picking. A face's own outward normal points away from the solid, so the plane is oriented to keep the model rather than discard it — for a face on the outside of a part nothing is cut until you drag, which then sweeps inward from that face. Custom normals persist to `<model>.view.json`.
- **Live operation preview** — the result of an in-progress edit is shown before you click Apply, coloured by intent (green additive, red subtractive, blue wire/reference), with per-operation cancellation. A preview never enters the op stack.
- **GiD postprocess import and export** (`.post.msh` with its `.post.res` companion), including the first compound-extension route — `.post.msh` ends in `.msh`, which belongs to Gmsh, so file-type matching now prefers the longest registered suffix.
- **meshio++ capability adoption, phases A–C.** `check_mesh_health` gained meshio++'s own surface diagnostics per component, including **inconsistent winding** — a signal the existing analyzer structurally cannot see, since it sorts each edge's endpoints before counting and so reads two oppositely-wound neighbours as a clean manifold edge. The colour-by-field picker now disables a non-colourable array up front with its component count, instead of failing after the click. And a new `transform_mesh` tool exposes clean/decimate/smooth/subdivide/refine/agglomerate/convertCells as one declarative op list, with each step that cannot run reported and skipped rather than silently dropped.
- **Analytic surface parameters, and a per-solid primitive recognition report.** `inspect` now returns `surfaceParams` for a curved face — a cylinder's radius and axis, a cone's signed half-angle with its apex, a sphere's centre and radius, a torus's major/minor radii — all in world coordinates, verified against faces this codebase built itself and against a filleted edge (the case that stands in for imported STEP). `recognize_primitives` reports, per solid, the face inventory by surface type, a candidate primitive only when that inventory matches a signature *exactly* (so a filleted box correctly reports no match, not a wrong one), and a residual against the idealized shape. Facts only — nothing is reclassified.
- **Fit a plane, cylinder, or sphere to a region of a mesh** (`fit_mesh_region`) — the mesh-side analogue of primitive recognition, for scans and other geometry with no analytic surfaces at all. Growing a region from a seed point (a dihedral-angle gate loose enough to walk across a tessellated curve, capped by size) and least-squares fitting all three shapes, each published with its own residual rather than a single winner — a flat region genuinely is also fitted by an enormous sphere, and the simpler shape only wins when it fits well enough on its own terms.
- **Named, persisted construction planes.** A clip plane (from an axis preset, a picked face, or three picked points) can now be saved under a name, or one entered numerically, and reused later — including after closing and reopening the file. A plane stores its resolved point and normal rather than a reference to the face it came from, so unlike Parts and pinned measurements it is never re-matched after an edit; it simply stays where it was put. `set_plane` lets an agent record one headlessly, e.g. from `inspect`'s own reported normal.

### Changed

- **Mass properties now use OCCT's adaptive integration** rather than the fixed-order overload, which under-integrates B-spline-trimmed faces. Volumes and areas shift by up to ~0.02% on curved models (a box is unchanged to floating point); every consumer — `get_mass_properties`, `compare_models`' deltas, `check_interference`, mesh-health volume deltas, assembly-tree fingerprints — is affected identically.
- **The viewer draws only when something changed.** Idle with a static model it renders zero frames, instead of redrawing continuously; and an edit-driven rebuild no longer re-frames the camera when the new geometry still fits within the previous view, so the model stops twitching on every edit.
- **3D scene colours follow the VS Code theme.** Faces, edges, points, the grid, the background, selection and measurement accents, the FE-mesh and hidden-line overlays all track light/dark/high-contrast, where previously every colour was a constant tuned for a dark theme. Per-Part colours you have chosen are never overwritten.
- **Sidecar writes refuse to clobber an unsaved editor buffer.** If a `.edits.json`/`.parts.json`/`.annotations.json`/`.mesh.json` is open with unsaved changes, the extension declines to overwrite it and says which file and what to do, instead of silently discarding your edits on the next autosave. The guard fails open — a broken guard must not also break saving.
- **A rejected edit op now explains itself.** `apply_edit_ops` and the parametric-script tools report why an op was rejected, quoting the expected parameter shape for that kind, and suggest the nearest real op kind for a misspelling — but only for a genuine near-miss, since a confidently wrong suggestion is worse than none.

### Fixed

- **Colour-by-field could leave the previous field's colours on screen.** A failed field pick reset only the dropdown, not the overlay or its legend, so the viewport kept showing stale colours under a legend reading "None". The failure message also guessed among three possible causes; it now names the actual one.
- **Region → Parts correlation was silently skipped for hexahedral meshes.** A hex volume's boundary is quads, which the correlation path required to be triangles, so a two-material hex mesh imported with no Parts at all. The boundary is now triangulated with its provenance preserved.
- **Tolerance bands on pinned measurements were silently inert.** A copy step used internally by the Saved-measurements list dropped the band before it could reach the sidecar, so nothing pinned with a tolerance ever actually persisted or rendered one, despite every automated test passing.
- **A sixth control-panel group could grow wide enough to cover the sidebar and swallow clicks there**, caught while adding the construction-planes UI. The new controls now nest inside the existing Clip group instead.

### Internal

- **Two automated test harnesses, closing a zero-coverage gap.** `npm run test:webview` asserts against the real shipped viewer bundle in headless Chromium (panels, picking, overlays, export serialization, idle-frame behaviour, and framing invariants that catch a blank or wildly misframed viewport); `npm run test:integration` runs a suite *inside* a real VS Code, covering extension activation, command registration, the export quick-pick/save-dialog flows, and the external-change file watchers. Both run in CI. Every webview feature's write-up previously ended with "not exercised in a real session" — much less is F5-only now.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **5 new importable formats, closing a real export/import asymmetry**: Gmsh Mesh (`.msh`/`.msh2`), Abaqus (`.inp`), I-DEAS Universal (`.unv`), SU2 (`.su2`), and INRIA Medit (`.mesh`). The FE Mesh panel already wrote all five via Gmsh's own writer, but there was no way to reopen any of them — each is now round-trip-verified against the live meshio++ WASM. `.msh`/`.inp` are ambiguous extensions (also used by ANSYS/FreeFem) — CAD Preview assumes its own output format and shows a one-line status caveat on open.
- **8 new mesh export formats** reachable from the FE Mesh panel's export dropdown and the `export_mesh` MCP tool, none of which Gmsh's bundled writer can produce at all: VTK XML Unstructured (`.vtu`), HDF Mesh Format (`.hmf`), AVS UCD (`.avs`), COMSOL Mphtxt (`.mphtxt`), Netgen (`.vol`), FLAC3D (`.f3grid`), Well-Known Text (`.wkt`), and Flux (`.pf3`) — all bridged through meshio++, the same way MED/CGNS/XDMF already were.

### Fixed

- **A `.xdmf` file exported by CAD Preview could never be reopened.** The host used to stage only a source file's own bytes into meshio++'s virtual filesystem, so an XDMF's `.h5` companion (needed by the default "HDF" data format) was never found on import, always failing with `HDF5: could not open file`. Opening an `.xdmf` now locates and stages its referenced `.h5` sibling automatically. (A separate, pre-existing meshio++ limitation was found while fixing this — an XDMF whose mesh mixes cell types, which this extension's own meshing always produces, still can't be re-meshed after reimport; the file opens normally, only re-meshing it fails, with a clear error. This is upstream meshio++ behavior, not something this extension controls.)

### Changed

- **`kernelIpc.ts`'s host↔worker IPC wire format hardened.** An unrecognized typed-array type crossing the boundary (e.g. a `Float64Array`, meshio++'s own native array type) used to silently mismarshal as a `Uint8Array` of the wrong length instead of failing loudly; it now throws a clear error at the boundary. `NaN`/`Infinity`/`-Infinity` values now round-trip correctly instead of silently becoming `null`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **DXF import and export** — the 2D drawing interchange format the CAM/laser-cutting/AutoCAD audience actually uses, at both ends of the pipeline. **File ▾ ▸ Import DXF…** reads a `.dxf` file's model-space `LINE` / `LWPOLYLINE` (bulge arcs sampled) / `POLYLINE` / `CIRCLE` / `ARC` / `SPLINE` entities into the existing sketch edit ops (B-rep sources only; blocks/INSERT/TEXT/DIMENSION/HATCH and paper space are skipped), and a new **File ▾ ▸ Export Silhouette DXF…** writes the silhouette outline as minimal model-space `ENTITIES` (`LWPOLYLINE` chains + `LINE` singletons) over the exact same segment list the SVG exporter serializes — so an SVG and a DXF of one view are geometrically consistent. The `export_svg_silhouette` MCP tool gained an optional `format: "svg" | "dxf"` param (plus `chainCount`/`lineCount` in the response) rather than a second tool.
- **Split view with per-pane cameras.** View ▾ now offers 1×1 / 1×2 / 2×1 / 2×2 viewport layouts over one scene — each pane its own orbitable camera, the orientation cube and gizmo following focus, selection/display modes/clip planes shared across all panes. Layouts and each pane's camera persist to `<model>.view.json`, so reopening restores exactly what you left.
- **Linked cameras across tabs** (View ▾): when enabled, orbiting/zooming one open CAD Preview tab drives every other open tab's camera in real time.
- **Query-based selection filters** (Select ▾): select faces by direction, planarity, area threshold, or largest/smallest N; lines by axis alignment, length, or longest/shortest N — with a seam-exclusion toggle and Select/Add buttons, instead of clicking entities one by one.
- **OpenFOAM case import** (`.foam` marker files) via the meshio++ bridge, and Kratos MDPA files with non-sequential node ids now load correctly (meshio++ ≥ 9.13).
- **Op-history scrubbing**: the Edits panel's history is now click-to-jump — applied ops render normally and redo-buffer ops render as dimmed pending rows; clicking any row moves the stack straight to that point in one step.
- **Five new MCP tools for agent workflows.** `list_workspace_models` walks a directory for CAD files and reports which sidecars each already has (a stateless discovery step that needs no kernel call at all); `check_interference_all` checks every Part against every other in one parse rather than one call per pair, with an axis-aligned bounding-box pre-filter and a `screenedByBbox` flag on pairs it separated without a real boolean; `generate_bom` emits one row per Part with volume, area and centroid, as TSV or JSON — volumes are deliberately **sum-of-parts**, so overlapping members each count in full, matching procurement convention; `render_ops_prefix` renders the model as of op N without mutating the edits sidecar, for bisecting which op broke something; and `measure_exact` gained `centreDistance` plus, for two planar faces, the angle between their normals and — when parallel — the perpendicular gap, with a `primary` field naming which of the two fits the pair's geometry.
- **Named views for silhouette export and snapshots**, shared from one vocabulary so an SVG and a snapshot of "the same view" genuinely agree.

### Changed

- **Mesh mass properties now warn when a mesh source isn't watertight**, since the computed volume may not be meaningful for an open surface.
- **Picking ignores hidden geometry** — clicks no longer land on entities hidden via a Part's eye toggle, Isolate, or an active FE-mesh overlay.
- **Edit replay outcomes are visible**: an op that silently skipped during replay (unresolved operands after an id shift, a fillet radius too large, …) is now marked ⚠ in the Edits history with a diagnostic and hint, surfaced as warnings by the MCP tools instead of looking like a quiet no-op.
- **Dense-mesh safety guard**: Boolean/hole operations on a webview-side mesh above ~150 k combined triangles are refused with guidance to promote to B-rep first, instead of freezing the UI.
- **Faster picking on large meshes**: kept-whole meshes (organic scans above the facet limit) build a BVH acceleration structure, turning raycasting from milliseconds to near-zero per move.
- **Document-derived text is sanitized** — meshio region/data-array names quoted in status lines, MCP warnings, and auto-created Part names are stripped of control/bidi/format characters and truncated, so a hostile file can't smuggle instructions through them.
- **`inspect` now reports `planeOrigin` for planar faces** (the plane's own origin, usable directly as `planePoint` for Split/Section/Mirror), alongside the existing normal.
- **Mirror rejects a zero-length `planeNormal` up front** (sidecar parse, MCP, and parametric scripts) instead of silently skipping during replay.
- Dependency refreshes: `@meshioplusplus/wasm` 10.x (OpenFOAM reader/writer, MDPA id preservation), `js-yaml` 4.3.1, dev-dependency group bumps.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **SVG silhouette export.** A new **File ▾ ▸ Export Silhouette SVG…** (and the `CAD Preview: Export Silhouette SVG…` command, and the `export_svg_silhouette` MCP tool) writes a 2D outline of the model as a vector drawing — from the view you're currently looking at, or from a named view (Front/Back/Top/Bottom/Left/Right/Iso). Works for every source with host-side geometry: STEP/IGES/BREP with edits baked in, plus STL/OBJ/PLY/glTF. 1 SVG unit = 1 model unit, so it prints 1:1, and the same mm/cm/m/in/ft conversion every other export offers applies here too. **It is an outline, not a dimensioned technical drawing** — there is no hidden-line removal, so interior feature edges that don't lie on a silhouette aren't drawn. (OCCT's hidden-line machinery is entirely unavailable in this WebAssembly build; the one remaining alternative was probed against the live kernel and produced a visibly worse drawing, missing holes and cutouts the shipped approach draws correctly.)
- **Compare Models, mesh health, and Mesh → B-rep promotion now support glTF/GLB**, the last format that was still excluded. `CAD Preview: Compare Models…` (and `compare_models`) can now diff `.gltf`/`.glb` against any other supported format, `check_mesh_health` reports on them, and `promote_mesh_to_brep` turns one into a real STEP/IGES/BREP solid. This is a new host-side glTF parser, cross-validated in the test suite against three.js's own loader — the same loader the 3D view already uses to display these files — which is what made hand-rolling it defensible after it was previously ruled out for lack of a way to validate it.

### Changed

- **Mesh health and promotion now refuse a mesh above 50 000 triangles** with a clear message instead of grinding to a halt. Both build one CAD face per triangle, which was always a risk for a large mesh and becomes a likely one now that glTF — a rendering format whose files are routinely far larger than hand-authored STL/OBJ/PLY — is accepted.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **STEP assembly structure.** The Components tree now shows a STEP file's real nested assembly/component hierarchy — matching how the file's author organized it — instead of always flattening every solid into one list; a source with no real assembly structure still falls back to the flat list as before. STEP export now also carries per-part names into the exported file's `PRODUCT` entities (per-label colors remain unsupported — confirmed non-functional in both directions in this OCCT build).
- **Standard Parts panel.** Search the hosted [step.parts](https://www.step.parts) catalog (fasteners, bearings, connectors, extrusions, …) and insert a result as a new STEP document with one click, from a new sidebar section — previously only available to AI agents via the `search_standard_parts`/`download_standard_part` MCP tools.
- **Align and Linear/Circular Pattern** edit ops, in the Edits panel's Assembly category.
- **Transform Gizmo.** Move/Rotate/Scale now show a draggable 3D handle that live-previews the edit before you click Apply, with optional **Snap to grid** / **Snap to points** (View ▾).
- **Import SVG…** (File ▾) traces a `.svg` file's paths into B-rep sketch polylines, ready to build into a surface or extrude.
- **A cancellable progress notification** for slow STEP/IGES/BREP loads (first open, or reopening after an external change) — clicking Cancel stops the result from being applied. Routine edits stay on the lightweight toolbar status line, since they're normally near-instant.
- **OCCT, Gmsh, and meshio++ now run in a forked child process**, both in the extension and in the standalone MCP server. A hung or crashed kernel operation no longer wedges the whole extension/server — it's killed and a fresh one takes over automatically for the next operation — and Cancel now genuinely interrupts a slow load instead of only discarding its result once it eventually finishes.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **Unit conversion on export, now everywhere it can be done correctly** — BREP, STL, OBJ, PLY, and glTF exports (and, separately, the FE Mesh panel's own Gmsh-format export: `.msh`, Kratos MDPA, VTK, and the rest) can now be scaled to mm/cm/m/in/ft on the way out, a real geometric transform applied to the exported file's coordinates, not just a display change. STEP/IGES exports deliberately stay native mm — this OCCT WASM build has no verified way to set those formats' own declared header unit, and shipping a file whose header disagrees with its geometry would be worse than not offering the option.
- **IGES unit detection** — the view-controls Units dropdown now auto-detects and selects an opened IGES file's declared unit, the same way it already did for STEP.
- **Compare Models now supports STL, OBJ, and PLY**, in addition to STEP/IGES/BREP — `CAD Preview: Compare Models…` (and the `compare_models` MCP tool) can diff any combination of these formats against each other, via new host-side parsers (glTF remains unsupported: a correct parser needs meaningfully more surface area than the others, with no realistic way to validate it against real-world exporter variety).
- **Exact-precision measurement** — a new "⟟ Exact" button next to a completed Distance / Edge Length / Radius measurement recomputes it against the true OCCT geometry instead of the displayed triangulation; also available headless as the new `measure_exact` MCP tool.
- **Best-effort entity-id rebinding** — a Part assigned to a face or edge now usually keeps pointing at the right geometry after a Boolean, Fillet, or feature-modeling edit applied elsewhere in the model, instead of silently losing that reference the next time the file reloads.
- **meshio++ import visibility** — opening a VTK/MED/CGNS/Exodus/XDMF/MDPA file now shows a status line (and a `load_model` warning via MCP) naming any named regions and data arrays the source file declares. Still geometry-only — nothing is converted into Parts or colourable data yet — but no longer silent about what's actually in the file.

### Fixed

- The MCP server (and its `render_snapshot` tool) no longer crashes outright on Node.js < 20. A routine Playwright dependency update started calling `process.exit()` at import time on older Node versions — not a catchable exception — so the server now checks the Node version before ever attempting that import, degrading gracefully instead.

### Changed

- Bumped `@meshioplusplus/wasm` to 9.9.0.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Toolbar dropdown menus.** The toolbar had grown to ~21 controls in one strip; it's now three always-visible buttons (**Fit**, **Tree**, **FE&nbsp;Mesh**) plus four dropdowns — **View ▾** (Grid, Edges, Screenshot), **Select ▾** (selection mode + Point/Vol/Surf/Line), **Measure ▾** (measure mode + Distance/Length/Angle/Radius + Clear), and **Markup ▾** (markup mode + the six drawing tools, colour, Undo/Redo/Clear). A trigger stays highlighted while its mode is active, so you can still tell at a glance that Measure or Markup is live once the panel has closed. Measurement results moved to their own line below the toolbar.
- **A complete icon set.** Every remaining emoji (`▦ 📐 📷 ✎`) and unicode placeholder (`⊙ ＋ ↶ ↷`) is now a generated, monochrome SVG icon that tracks the VS Code theme — 41 icons in total, covering the toolbar, both tool pickers, the five Display modes, and the Parts/Edits/Variables/FE&nbsp;Mesh panel buttons. The Edits panel's 46 op buttons (Move, Box, Fillet, Boolean Subtract, and so on) are now real icons too, replacing their unicode placeholders.
- **Display modes** — five mutually exclusive whole-model rendering modes (Shaded, Wireframe, X-Ray, Hidden Lines, Flat), replacing the old standalone Wireframe toggle.
- **Markup annotations** — draw freehand/line/arrow/rectangle/circle review notes over the 3D view, with undo/redo and an eraser. Session-only, and baked into Screenshot exports.
- **Measurement tools** — distance, edge length, angle, and radius, shown as a live overlay in the view.
- **Mass properties** — volume, surface area, centre of mass, and moments of inertia for the whole model or a selected solid/face/edge.
- **Screenshot** — save the current view as a PNG from the toolbar, the File menu, or the `CAD Preview: Screenshot to PNG…` command.
- **Settings** — cross-document defaults under **CAD Preview** in the Settings UI: `background`, `showGridAndAxesOnOpen`, `upAxis`, and `defaultMeshSizePreset`.
- **Visualization and UX depth** — drag-and-drop to open, per-part isolate/hide plus a Components-tree filter, a live exploded-view slider, background/opacity controls, live clipping/section planes, FE mesh quality statistics, and an orthographic/perspective camera toggle.
- **Capped clipping planes.** The live clip/section plane now shows a real solid cross-section at the cut face instead of a see-through hollow.
- **Units handling** — the declared unit of a STEP file is detected and shown, and a display-unit selector (mm/cm/m/in/ft) rescales mass-properties and measurement readouts. Presentation only; stored geometry is unchanged.
- **Model comparison** — `CAD Preview: Compare Models…` diffs two B-rep documents and reports matched/added/removed solids with the centre displacement and volume delta behind each match.
- **meshio++ integration** — VTK/VTU, MED, CGNS, Exodus, XDMF, and Kratos MDPA files open as viewable boundary surfaces, and generated FE meshes can be exported to MED, CGNS, and XDMF (formats Gmsh's own writers can't produce). Geometry only — region names and field data are not preserved.
- **Hex-dominant meshing** — a third element shape alongside simplex and subdivided, producing a mixed tet/hex mesh.
- **Save / Load Preprocess** — bundle a CAD file and its sidecars into a single `.zip` and restore it later.
- **New MCP tools for agents** — `inspect` and `measure` (fact-only entity queries), `render_snapshot` (headless multi-view images), `get_mass_properties`, `compare_models`, `search_standard_parts` / `download_standard_part` (fasteners, bearings, and more from [step.parts](https://www.step.parts)), and `run_parametric_script` for declarative, re-runnable part scripts.

### Changed

- Default 3D meshing algorithm is now Gmsh's own Delaunay, after the wasm-stack-overflow bug that forced the Frontal workaround was fixed upstream in `@loumalouomega/gmsh-wasm` 0.3.0. Existing documents keep whatever is already saved in their `.mesh.json`.
- Bumped `@meshioplusplus/wasm` to 9.8.0, which closes two upstream gaps this extension previously had to work around: exporting a generated mesh to MED now preserves part names directly (no more MED-specific two-step), and exporting a 2D-dimension mesh to CGNS now produces a file that reads back correctly (it used to round-trip cleanly only for 3D volume meshes).

### Fixed

- The **File ▾** menu could not be dismissed by clicking its own icon — the click closed and immediately reopened it.
- Clicking away from an open menu no longer also acts on whatever is underneath; with markup mode on, that click used to draw a stroke.
- The measurement pick marker rendered at a fixed 1 world-unit size — massive and out of proportion on small (e.g. mm-scale) models. It now scales with the model, matching the existing point-mode vertex markers.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Dependency maintenance: bumped `actions/setup-node` and `softprops/action-gh-release`, and added `package.json` overrides for `vite`, `fast-uri`, and `@hono/node-server`.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- A "What's New" panel that opens automatically the first time you use the extension after an update, summarizing everything that changed since the version you last had installed. It won't show again until the next update; reopen it anytime via **CAD Preview: Show What's New** in the Command Palette (which always shows the full changelog).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- Dependency maintenance: bumped `esbuild`, `typescript`, `@types/node`, `@vscode/vsce`, `three` / `@types/three`, `vitest`, `three-bvh-csg`, and several GitHub Actions (`upload-pages-artifact`, `deploy-pages`, `upload-artifact`, `dependency-review-action`, `checkout`) to their latest compatible versions.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- Adjusted gmsh-wasm handling in the esbuild config and `.vscodeignore` so the packaged extension bundles it correctly.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- Marked `ws` as external in the esbuild config and adjusted gmsh-wasm initialization to fix packaging/runtime issues introduced in 1.0.0.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- First stable 1.0 release. Version and dependency bump; adjusted gmsh-wasm loading in `gmshService.ts` and fixed the MCP server's reported version.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Save/preprocessing improvements around the sidecar save pipeline (Save, Save As, Export flows).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **MCP server**: a standalone stdio MCP server (`dist/mcp-server.js`) exposing the load/edit/mesh/export pipeline to AI agents with no VS Code required — load models, apply edit operations, generate meshes, and export, all headless.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- New automated screenshot-generation pipeline for documentation (`npm run docs:screenshots`), rendering the real shipped viewer DOM against live OCCT/Gmsh output instead of hand-captured images.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Top **File** menu (Open / Save / Save As / Export) with matching commands and keybindings (`Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Shift+S`, `Ctrl+E`).

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Parametric variables**: named variables (e.g. `L = 20`) usable as expressions in edit-operation fields, with live re-resolution when a variable changes.
- Operation removal: a per-row control to remove a single op from the edit history without discarding everything applied after it.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-06

### Improved

- General meshing improvements to the GMSH-based FE meshing pipeline.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Redesigned Edits panel with **GEOMETRY** / **EDIT** top-level tabs (2D/3D subtabs under GEOMETRY) and 16 new modeling operations.
- Replaced emoji toolbar/panel icons with theme-adaptive, monochrome SVG icons that track VS Code's light/dark theme.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

## [0.5.6] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Meshing panel refinements: size controls and large-mesh warning follow-up.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- VS Code Marketplace publishing step in the CI workflow.

### Fixed

- Documentation formatting corrections.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **FE meshing** via GMSH-WASM: generate finite-element meshes (nodes + triangles/tetrahedra) from the displayed model, shown as an overlay.
- Parts-preserving meshing (Gmsh physical groups) and multi-format mesh export, including Kratos MDPA.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Non-destructive geometry editing**: transforms (move/rotate/scale/ mirror), booleans, fillet/chamfer, feature modeling (extrude/revolve/ sweep/loft), primitives, 2D profile sketches, and bottom-up wireframe modeling (points/lines/arcs → surfaces → volumes). Edits persist to a `<model>.edits.json` sidecar and are re-applied on every open; the source CAD file is never modified.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Geometry parts**: assign volumes, surfaces, and lines to named parts by clicking in the view. Assignments persist to a `<model>.parts.json` sidecar.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- View-manipulation panel (stepped rotate/pan/zoom, fit-to-view) and an orientation gizmo cube.
- VitePress-based documentation site.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Updated the extension publisher id to `kratos-multiphysics`.

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflow to build and package the extension (`.vsix`) for releases.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Initial release: read-only 3D preview for CAD and mesh files (STEP, IGES, BREP, STL, OBJ, PLY, glTF) inside a VS Code custom editor, using OpenCascade.js (OCCT WASM) in the extension host for B-rep formats and Three.js in the webview for rendering.
